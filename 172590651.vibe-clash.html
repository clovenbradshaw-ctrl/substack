<h2>The Vibe Clash at the Heart of It All</h2><p><strong>Non-profits doing advocacy work are messy.</strong> They’re often pretty toxic to work at. As an industry, they suffer from a similar fate as the entertainment world, where people often come to it from a sense of purpose, and those in power often use that <em>purpose motive</em> to exploit people for cheap labor. “Sure, but if I quit, <em>who’s gonna look after these folks?</em>” </p><p>Tensions can run high at non-profits, even when conflict resolution is built into the vibe. They also run high when dealing with other organizations. Or when they have to engage with government and business interests that affect the people they serve. This vibe, talking things through, the role of <em>feelings</em>, those are not things your average business person or bureaucrat wants to deal with. But they’re an ever-present part of the world of advocating for the needs of others.</p><p>One of the most central causes of burnout is having high expectations of yourself but lacking the resources to accomplish that. This is the world of the non-profit homelessness advocate in a nutshell.</p><p>Government bureaucrats and business people tend to look on advocates, like people who dedicate their lives to advocating for the unhoused, with an exasperated weariness. “Them again?”</p><p>The “real world”, to these institutionalists, is a set of train schedules of capital and documents to keep in order. Money must arrive by X date for Y’s shovels to appear and only then with Z provides the finishing funds so that Mary and John Q. Gentrifier can move in (assuming they have good enough credit) before the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>This sequence is a delicate order that’s often upset by the parochial fixation of certain advocacy orgs, groups who fling words like “human dignity” and “best practices” as if these are magic words that, if stated forcefully and earnestly enough, will warm the hearts and minds of even the coldest capitalist.</p><p>If you are trying to build a park, or a stadium, or run a chicken-friend version the Las Vegas strip, you are <em>on a schedule</em>. And if there happen to be people near there, people who, for a wide variety of reasons rarely if ever their fault, do not have a place indoors to live and have aggregated there — that can really be a time sink. And you’ve got places to be! Aspen doesn’t ski itself!</p><p>Dealing with advocates from the non-profit world, people whose work attire doesn’t quite have that Green Hills Mall business casual vibe, workers are more often than not <em>women</em> and who unconsciously bring their horizontal power structures into spaces that are very much top-down, people whose professional commitment to authenticity can make subtextual powerbrokering crunchier than one might hope — they can be annoying to deal with for the professional who is just trying to get a Dunkin’ opened on Gallatin. Their problems, this whole “what to do with the unhoused people?” are these even <em>real problems? Give em a tent and a sandwich! But not cash, who knows what they’ll spend it on.</em></p><p>Because the things is, real estate investors do not care about if there is a meaningful backlog of permanent supportive housing to place these people in. Agitated neighbors, understandably frustrated that their community park has somehow become the permanent home of people they find unsavory, usually don’t wait for the right services to be available to try reclaim the land from these squatting intruders. (“They were probably bussed here from another state!”) The displaced park users take their first opportunity to harass their Council Member to do something, or else find a political challenger who will. And this is their god given right, and the tension generated here is how the machine of democracy functions.</p><p>But things move slow in the homelessness world, for an exceptionally simple reason. The causes of homelessness are multi-variate and nuanced, different for each person. But the cure to homelessness, or at least the foundational first thing you need to overcome chronic homelessness, is simple: a home.</p><p>And there just ain’t a lot of those for people who have credit scores even worse than mine.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>An aside on a pernicious myth that helps hold up a worldview.</strong></p><p>I’ve had two Metro Council Members say to me that that the real problem in the  homelessness system, is the homeless advocates. They’re actually the problem, because they’re actually incentivized to NOT solve the problem. </p><p><em>Because when you think about it, if we fix homelessness, these non-profits are out of a job. Their donations are for serving the homeless. If we actually get them off the streets and out the camps, who are they going to serve? It’s only logical.</em></p><p>It’s a real, <em>telling on yourself</em> kind of thing to say.</p><p>But there is a certain, 4th grade logic to this, always shared conspiratorially like you’re being let in on the <em>the one big lie</em> that’s gonna make it all make sense. </p><p>When the first duly elected Metro Council Member said this to me, I was flummoxed. </p><p>I said something like: “That’s a really cynical view of human nature I haven’t heard you expressing so far on this call. Do you really think these people are not actually trying to help these folks?” </p><p>Their response was more or less, <em>well that’s just my opinion</em>. To be generous, I am always thirsty to spot “perverse incentives” — like when we implement public safety laws that actually increase crime by disenfranchising people and making their lives harder, and in turn our police budgets go up and our prison spending goes up. Totally a thing, really dark, very real. We need to identify these perverse incentives and stop them.</p><p>I can only assume that the Council Member who brought this theory up does not limit their skepticism of humans <em>creating problems so they can solve them</em> to those working poverty wages trying to end homelessness. I look forward to standing in solidarity with us as we criticize the MNPD’s budget next year. I say DEFUND you say….</p><p>The second time a Metro Council member said this to me, they were relaying this perspective from a senior official in Metro’s Office of Homeless Services. I had a more direct response this time, one that I think cut to the quick a bit better.</p><p><strong>“I’m sorry — are we at risk of solving homelessness? Is that a </strong><em><strong>thing we’re about to do?</strong></em><strong>”</strong> </p><p>If not for these <em>meddling kids</em> going around <em>pretending</em> to be spending hours every day calling slumlords so people don’t have to live under a tarp, when <em>actually</em> they’re running hedges funds buying up real estate, letting houses sit empty to drive up the market for a 1BD, happy to operate thousands of unoccupied units at a loss because they’re just going to sell the whole portfolio to another firm once their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/quants-quantitative-analyst.asp">quants</a> tell them the bubble’s about to burst. These damn social workers and their multi-national private equity firms, causing homelessness so they can get donations and make $32,000 a year!</p><p>The people who’ve said this to me are not dumb people. They’re actually quite astute, critical, self-aware people. I know they both came away from our conversations genuinely weirded out that they didn’t actually disagree with me about everything. We should set up field trips between politicians and Leftists, they work hard they should get to take a break and have their minds blown.</p><p>But the thing is about the people who hold this opinion (or this weird conspiratorial meme of an idea), because they’re smart, thoughtful people normally, ideas like this really stick out to me. It’s an idea that allows a certain view of the world to be held up, and it justifies designing systems in certain ways, identifying one group as <em>the problem</em>, and the solution being to give all the power to the other half of the equation.</p><p>But for some weird reason… it ain’t working… Maybe the social workers are also secretly in league with ICE and are distracting all the local politicians who otherwise would be solving homelessness…</p><div><hr></div><h3>You Down with C-o-C?</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"

The creative tension this creates is kinda the whole point.</h4><blockquote><p>If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground.</p><p>-Frederick Douglass</p></blockquote><p>What tends to happen when these worlds collide over a patch of land, earmarked for one thing, but occupied by people with no where else to go, is a push and pull. A push from the interests of capital that have put a lot of treasure into getting the zoning they needed and the funding in place, and a pull from the network of service providers dedicated to making sure that the humanity of the people displaced is respected. They’re there to make sure they’re not simply loaded onto bus tickets with one-way fares on Tom Turner’s credit card (don’t worry, I’m sure he’ll get reimbursed for it) or charged with “felony camping”, a fun solution that just make the prison industrial complex’s problem to not solve. <em>You know, if we arrest enough unhoused people, we might could justify sending our friends at Core Civic a few more dollars…</em> </p><p>But mechanics of push-and-pull system around homelessness does not exist by accident. It was actually invented by the federal agency of Housing and Urban Development as model of distributing the authority and powers of the homelessness serving system across a given area’s providers. They called this system a “Continuum of Care,” and for a thing invented by the federal government in the 1990s, it is a surprisingly decent idea.</p><p>Every metro area has funds that flow to it from the federal government (well, they used to, TBD on how this will change in the next few months). Instead of allocating this money directly to local government to spend however they felt best, the system collectively has input on how these funds are spent. And they have, when its implemented right, other systemic power distributed throughout the system.</p><p>In every CoC, all the service providers have to work together. There are four things they must have. </p><ol><li><p>They must compile their funding applications together. </p></li><li><p>They must share their data with one another.</p></li><li><p>They must have a designee that enters people into their system for support.</p></li><li><p>They must have a board that oversees their work.</p></li></ol><p>These four things are specific roles that HUD requires every CoC has. And when well executed, it can align with what the 2009 Economics Nobel Prize Winner Elinor Ostrom would call a "polycentric collective commons" system.</p><p>The graphic novel about storytelling I read once tells me now is a good time for a human interest story. So let’s learn about a cool ass lady named Elinor Ostrom.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Elinor Ostrom: Early Life, Accomplishments, Theory&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Elinor Ostrom: Early Life, Accomplishments, Theory&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Elinor Ostrom: Early Life, Accomplishments, Theory" title="Elinor Ostrom: Early Life, Accomplishments, Theory" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rGL2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83f61df4-0476-42ef-be9c-60bd89950de4_1500x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Elinor Ostrom wasn't supposed to win a Nobel Prize.

So she went to political science at UCLA instead, where she met Vincent Ostrom in a graduate seminar on water resources.

doing her fieldwork, the dominant economic narrative had already decided how the world worked. The tragedy of the commons was gospel - a meme that contained the whole of neo-liberalism in a nutshell, the unchallenged axiom that <strong>shared resources would inevitably be destroyed by selfish individuals</strong>. Its is a strange, pernicious little little that has built the world today as we know it — one where highly educated, serious people tell us that we can’t have nice things, like a communal meadows, because <em>someone might misuse it.</em> And we should therefore trust them / their friend who runs a multi-national corporation to <em>make sure its put to good use.</em> </p><p>Facing this imaginary crisis that actually has no historical context and kinda seems actually to be <em>selfish people just taking shit and justifying it, </em>there were only two solutions the establishment recognized: privatize everything, or have government control it.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

By the 1980s, this thinking was reshaping the world. Reagan and Thatcher were privatizing public services. The World Bank was forcing developing countries to privatize water systems and forests. The Chicago School economists had it all figured out: rational self-interest plus private property rights equals efficiency. Anything held in common was just socialism by another name, doomed to fail.</p><p>And you’re not a socialist, <em>are you? </em>Don’t answer that.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and this once-fringe ideology is now thoroughly mainstream in America, deeply entrenched even in the Democratic Party in what is called “neo-liberalism.” Sure, Democrats reject the populist authoritarian approach of controlling everything from the top - but suggest that communities might manage their own resources without credentialed experts and watch them squirm. Literally, go to city hall, interrupt an East Bank development meeting and pitch it. I dare you.</p><p>The modern liberal establishment needs its bureaucrats, its McKinsey consultants, its metrics and best practices and stakeholder engagement sessions. The idea that a bunch of fishermen might know more about managing fisheries than someone with a Kennedy School degree? Blasphemy. That homeless service providers might organize themselves better than <em>some lady that the county’s chief of operations knows</em> could restructure them? That's perhaps more threatening than authoritarianism - because it suggests the professional managerial class might not be essential after all.</p><p>Think of all the Brooks Brothers that would put in the soup line! What if they had to talk to a social worker?!</p><p>But instead of harping on Substack about local politics like some real dingus ass losers you know, Lin (as her friends called her) did something radical. She went outside and looked at what actually happened.</p><p>She studied Japanese villages where farmers had shared irrigation systems for centuries - no private ownership, no government control, just farmers managing water together. She observed Maine lobstermen who somehow avoided fishing their waters empty through informal territories and self-imposed limits. She documented Swiss farmers sharing Alpine meadows through systems older than capitalism itself. In Nepal, Turkey, California - everywhere she looked, she found communities managing shared resources without the collapse everyone predicted.</p><p>These weren't socialist utopias or primitive holdovers. They were sophisticated systems that outperformed both government management and private ownership. The Swiss didn't need to sell their meadows to Nestlé to manage them efficiently. The Maine lobstermen didn't need fishing quotas imposed from Washington or individual transferable quotas traded on markets.</p><p>The economics establishment was skeptical. She was doing fieldwork like an anthropologist rather than building mathematical models. Critics dismissed her findings as merely anecdotal, as quirky exceptions to the iron laws of economics. But those "exceptions" kept accumulating into an undeniable pattern that has opened up an entire new era of economics. One that is both incredibly novel and progressive, and also far older and more established than the strange technocratic managed-democracy that the consulting class has inflicted upon the western world with dismal results (leading directly to the currently unfolding conservative populist backlash rending our constitution at its seams).</p><p>In 2009, Ostrom became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, essentially for proving that the market fundamentalists and government planners were both wrong. There was a third way - communities governing themselves.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

She identified eight design principles that showed up in communities that successfully managed shared resources for generations. What made these systems work wasn't abstract values like democracy or fairness. They actually <em>worked better</em> at preventing resource collapse and adapting to changes - outperforming both government control and private ownership in many cases.</p><p>The crucial difference? The rules came from the people using the resource, not from distant bureaucrats or market forces. When things changed, these communities could adapt quickly because the decision-makers were the same people dealing with the consequences.</p><p>When it works — and that's a big "when" — a homelessness Continuum of Care becomes a living experiment in this kind of collective action. The service providers, despite their resource constraints and philosophical differences, are forced into structured interdependence. The shelter needs the mental health agency's data. The housing navigator needs the medical respite program to stabilize clients. The street outreach team needs everyone else to have capacity, or their work becomes endless crisis management.</p><p>But unlike Ostrom's fishing villages, where the resource being managed is tangible and finite, CoCs are managing something far more complex: the intersection of human crisis and bureaucratic machinery, where the "resource" is both limited funding and even more limited housing stock, and the "commons" is the shared responsibility for society's most vulnerable members.</p><p>For CoCs, this suggests that the messy, frustrating process of getting providers to work together might actually be a feature, not a bug - if the system is set up right.</p><p>No one I’ve talked to has told be that Nashville has had a Continuum of Care that was ever <em>highly functioning.</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png" width="1456" height="841" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:841,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:632050,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/172538466?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Wejd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F121dd5de-0a2a-4fe7-90bf-2b747c498f92_2036x1176.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In 2018, Nashville began to embark on an experiment of its own.

That 10 year plan did not exactly go as planned. And, perhaps through the hard work of those self-sabotaging social workers, playing double agents on the front lines while making 30% of the area median income, we still have an exceptionally high per

reducing duplication and improving coordination among the city's homeless service providers.</p><p>However, this experiment in consolidation would prove to be just the beginning of Nashville's journey toward increasingly centralized control. The 2018 restructuring still left homeless services buried within Metro Social Services, lacking direct access to mayoral decision-making and struggling with what providers would later describe as inadequate support and visibility. </p><p>These structural limitations would prompt Council Member Freddie O'Connell to push for even greater consolidation in 2021-2022, ultimately creating the Office of Homeless Services as a standalone department with unprecedented control over funding, data, and housing placements—setting the stage for the current tensions between centralized authority and the collaborative, polycentric governance models that research suggests are more effective for managing complex social challenges.</p><p>What seems to have gone ignored is that the homelessness system in Nashville, though incredibly complex, <em>is able</em> to follow some simple input/output rules. </p><p>From 2020 to 2021, Nashville’s homelessness system had its funding doubled because of COVID relief funds dedicated mostly to rapid re-housing (which is what it sounds like). This doubling of funding had a real impact, directly correlating with housing placements also doubling.</p><p>Since 2021, the overall funding passing through Metro for homelessness has doubled again, exceeding $46.6M. Yet housing placements have not moved.</p><p>Encampment closures (moving people out of the way of the unfunded Wharf Park or from the riverbank near the new stadium), the number of people moved out of encampments into non-permanent housing <em>has gone up.</em> In fact, it is the only metric that does correlate with the additional funding that’s been sunk into the system. </p><p>But the overall rate of people being housed has not gone up, so logic tells us that either these folks are just being relocated from a camp that is somewhere in convenient and moved elsewhere without permanent housing, or if they are placed in permanent housing, they are cutting the line of the thousands of people, many <em>many </em>of them children, who are waiting on lists for housing. Those in encampments just had the good luck of being somewhere they weren’t supposed to be, and were able to cut-the-line to help make a developers life easier. </p><p>This is <em>precisely</em> the type of perverse incentives that CoC systems are designed to prevent, and is why city’s have not been the primary recipient of funding, nor are they recommended to be the primarily (or in Nashville, exclusive) holder of all levers of systemic power. It’s not radical observation, but city’s and Mayor’s Office tend to be somewhat captured by development interests, and so putting all of the systemic eggs in that same basket is, from a systems design perspective, sort of an obviously terrible idea.</p><p>Now, I don’t want to be conspiratorial but… maybe, just maybe… <em><strong>those pesky social workers</strong> all secretly own construction companies and they’re bankrolling the developers to get them to pretend that they won’t support the Mayor’s re-election and they’re actually the ones who hid the benches because they want Jacob Kupin to have to say he likes the big balls because its funny to be talking about balls so much in public meetings and then the stadium deal was actually set up by them because they’re heavily invested into the WNBA which is the direct competition to the NFL and they’re pulling a The Producers style scheme to make the Titans have the worst season in professional football history so they can buy out the team and sell it….</em></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Next time: we’ll talk about what specific steps were taken to dismantle the autonomy of Nashville’s CoC, and why this is not just a one-off, local issue, but an archetype for the ways in which neo-liberalism has failed, and made our society thirsty for any alternative (except the one that works).</strong></p><div data-component-name="FragmentNodeToDOM"><p>Elinor Ostrom’s 8 Design Principles, as applied to Continuums of Care</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clearly defined boundaries</strong> - Who has rights to use resources and what the boundaries of the resource system are (for CoCs: which providers are in, what geography is covered, who qualifies for services)</p></li><li><p><strong>Congruence between rules and local conditions</strong> - Rules fit local needs and the costs/benefits are proportionate (urban vs. rural CoCs need different approaches; compliance requirements should match local capacity)</p></li><li><p><strong>Collective-choice arrangements</strong> - Those affected by rules can participate in modifying them (people experiencing homelessness and frontline workers should have real voice, not token representation)</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Monitors audit both resources and user behavior, accountable to users (HMIS data plus actual outcome tracking, with monitors answerable to the community not just HUD)</p></li><li><p><strong>Graduated sanctions</strong> - Rule violators face proportionate consequences that escalate (agencies might get training, then technical assistance, then funding restrictions for non-compliance)</p></li><li><p><strong>Conflict-resolution mechanisms</strong> - Rapid, low-cost, local ways to resolve disputes (when providers clash over responsibilities, there's a clear process that doesn't require federal intervention)</p></li><li><p><strong>Recognition of rights to organize</strong> - External authorities recognize self-governance rights (HUD respects local CoC decisions; CoCs maintain autonomy from political interference)</p></li><li><p><strong>Nested enterprises</strong> - Multiple organizational layers for complex systems (neighborhood outreach, city-wide coordinated entry, regional HMIS, federal funding all working as connected but distinct levels)</p></li></ul></div>
