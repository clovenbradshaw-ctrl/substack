<p><strong>A strange thing happens when you start making sense of a world that is designed to confuse you.</strong></p><p>People start calling you, asking you to breakfast.</p><p>Some of them look across their steak and eggs at you, the scales falling from their eyes, confused at the implausible conclusion that: "Maybe we're friends now. Maybe we've always been friends, actually."</p><p>Others don't invite you to breakfast.</p><p>They send out flares in the form of legalistic-sounding arguments and attempts to find your employer, to talk to your manager, to nip you in the bud before you enter the holiest of holies and submit a public records request of its priests. <em>“We’re spending how much on frankincense??”</em> They are the human psychosocial immune system who are only doing their job, to keep homeostasis of an organism designed for a certain placetime.</p><p>And after they haven't defeated you that way, they start looking at you quizzically. And then, with whiplash that might stun your better angels, they adjust to the new reality. Not one where the tables of power imbalance are overturned, but just one where you're also at the table. So take your seat, friend. Welcome to the Masters of the Universe.</p><p>Nah. I'm good.</p><p>I could have gone to private high school, my brother did. But I flunked the test on purpose.</p><p>Get in, loser. We're doing something different.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>L. Frank Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz, used children's novels as a vessel to deliver his learnings from the perennial wisdom traditions. He was a dabbler in Theosophy, the jambalaya religion of Madam Helena Blavaktsky and Henry Olcott, a millenniarian mix-em-up of East and West, and Baum knew how to pick out the best bits and leave the rest to keep simmering. To him, inside the inner sanctum of the Emerald City, behind the great façade, the wizard was just a man, sputtering, a con artist, himself from Kansas - puerile enough that James Franco was fitting casting in a 2013 film Disney would rather you not remember it made.</p><p>I've been talking to a friend lately about the biblical holiest of holies, the innermost room of the temple of Jerusalem in the first century AD, a house of God built on sand, its tent poles shaking during the era of The Gospels, eventually crushed by the Romans, but made brittle from internecine warfare that had more to do with semitic factions feuding over who should get to horde its resources. Its collapse ushered in a new era of faith: Rabbinical Judaism.</p><p>As an atheist, or maybe something worse, I find it strange and obvious that it was not the later, state-sponsored Christianity that truly embodied the teachings of the Nazarene Rabbi. The hidden — if unconscious — heir was rabbinic Judaism: stateless and dispersed, yet insistent that God shows favor to the lowly, and that the stranger among you is also your kin. </p><p>Religion is not the problem. It is the conflation of the State with the religious power over defining the metaphysical that is the problem. Because when results are required, people tasked with running governments quickly get focused on who <em>is</em> and <em>who is not</em> a person we have to care about.</p><p>Religion solves a problem for the State, something that even the atheist totalitarian states of last century figured out how to leverage. Making things better for everyone is hard. What if, the cruel dualistic logic goes, we didn't actually have to care about <em>everyone</em>?</p><p>Many people have crawled out of Plato’s cave and seen this nightmare for what it is. There are a few ways to respond when you learn how the sausage is made. Some people become vegans. Others open a slaughterhouse.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>I imagine that what the Nazarene found when He entered the holiest of holies, after turning over the tables of the money changers, was not a rube from Kansas behind a curtain. But nothing.</p><p>Solemn, impenetrable silence. And I imagine that his anger turned to confusion, and then understanding, and then amusement.</p><p>We mistook the sign for the signifier. We built an external system in the image of our internal struggle. An attempt to sooth our passions, but instead it ossified, it became unadaptable, it became predatory and colonialist. It became cancer as state policy.</p><p>But in the center, in the holiest of holies, in the third eye of the hurricane, He, like so many people who pull back the curtain, was offered the chalice. Drink of it, and die. Pass it on, and live to rule the empire. You now understand how the gears of the machine work. Congratulations! Would you like to take it for a spin?</p><p>Maybe He saw, his mind tessellating outwards, backwards, inwards, forwards, that every family, every tribe, every city, every empire, every form of gathering that didn't have names yet but follow the same ternary logic: the business, the union, the non-profit, the board, the commission, the improv group and the anarchist collective (groups whose very nature try to schism the foundations of what makes being a group possible) — each was itself the unfolding of an eternal psychodrama, where time and again, at new layers on layers, the dissident is offered the chalice and asked if they will drink.</p><p>What they choose affects how the system behaves next.</p><p>The thing He might have seen is that it’s not only about drinking or refusing. Those are the empire’s terms, the binary script it lays before every would-be dissident. The deeper move is to recognize the chalice as a stage device in that script, and to answer by stepping sideways, inventing a third path.</p><p>The thing He might have seen is that it's not the end of days to refuse the chalice. In fact few people actually drink its hemlock. It’s only when one does drink it, when the time is right for a new layer of recursion, that we see that the end of days is already upon us. But, He probably saw, the definite article there is misleading. It's the end of THOSE days, but the days, as days are prone to do, keep coming.</p><p>Eternal recursion recurs recursively. Same shit. Different day.</p><p>The organs that keep the body of the human world alive require the hive mind of those who've chosen the Blue Pill, this time. They shape our body politic for a certain context, for a certain world of meaning. And when context and design are aligned, their actions are the rhythmic in breath and out breath of an organic machine, part flesh part policy, a figure so in tune with its background that it eventually disappears, part of the furniture of our disinteresting reality.</p><p>The thing about context, though — it changes.</p><p>What He might have seen inside the tent in Jerusalem is that, in our day, just as in His, the surest way to be targeted as a radical is to look the Messiah Complex squarely in its face and ask the eternal meme: "It me?" The riddle of riddles, the square of the circle, the mystery of the Sphinx.</p><p>It presents as the ultimate hubris, to imagine yourself relevant enough to enter the holiest of holies, and ask: what is at the heart of this living thing we call humanity? The Praetorian guards have slain so many pretenders to the throne. Who are you to deign yourself worthy to be crowned king? Did you even go to grad school?</p><p>And that is where the test is.</p><p>When the psychosocial military industrial complex asks you: "Why do you think you should be king?" Your answer, even to yourself, is when you are choosing what type of game we are playing. And few of us get to change the rules of the game. So answer wisely.</p><p>The dialectical quagmire isn't in your defense of your worthiness, or your protestations of your humility. It's much more meta than that. It's how you feel about the question itself.</p><p>When you respond with why you're worthy to be king, you're saying we should be ruled by a tyrant.</p><p>When you say you're unworthy to be king, you're saying we still should be ruled, if but by a worthy tyrant.</p><p>Where is the emergent third? Where does democracy emerge? Where is there a world where each of us are kings, and so the society we form is not one of exploitation and extraction, but one where we negotiate the terms of our mutual self rule and the boundaries of our respective sovereignty?</p><p>Where we rule at round tables, and round tables around tables, interlocking — not in peace, but in organized discord. Harmony is birthed from dissonance. Harmony and dissonance co-constitute each other, but they are not ends in themselves.</p><p>And there, seated around us, like pagan ghosts that haunt even our most politically massaged river bank development plans, are figures in masks, who speak beyond words for the land and plants and all the beings who can't vote.</p><p>This is a new world with a new logic, moving beyond the binary dualism of us &amp; them. It requires us to include but transcend the old world, the old logic that can only assert or nullify, but not create.</p><p>The pretensions of music theory philosophers say that the mathematical purity of symphonies is near to the purpose of society: to make <strong>pure</strong> art. But that's rather self-serving, isn't it? Warmed over symphonies, the radical product of Austria's emergence from Christendom's stranglehold on entertainment doesn't hit the same in 2025 Nashville. What if we, crazy thought, allocated funds to create music of today to score the world of tomorrow?</p><p>What is Art? Art is the birthing ground of the dialectical organs that steers the thought of the possible into the Real of the probable.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><p>And so here we are, back at the realm of the Real. Let's stop talking in metaphors and say what we're meaning. Except, it all is metaphors, it is all illusion. The war on the victims of our own incompetence, served up as distraction from the causes of our own suffering: age of tale = [old as] time.</p><p>Take it from an atheist who has stared, like billions before and after me, Christ in the face. The Trinity, the non-dualistic King of Kings is not one thing but three: The monarch who steers what is probable. The Immigrant, the stranger amongst us, who makes the world possible. And the Neighbor, the living pattern of relation, who is all of these at once.</p><p>We are, like every era, sleep walking inside of our own pathologies, paranoid that we’re going to be outed as an actor ill fitting the role we’ve stumbled into.</p><p>Can I herald, like John the Baptist, a voice in the wilderness, for there to be someone who can actually be awake to what this moment needs? Are there any, you know, adults around? And if indeed it is <em>just us who are the adults</em>, anyone got any pointers? </p><p>There is a Chinese myth about Laozi. That he grew weary of China’s obsession with hierarchy and the moral decline in the Zhou dynasty. Heartbroken by the degeneration of his nation, he climbed atop a water buffalo, and took off for the Western gate out of the empire. </p><p>There at the gate he was recognized by a guard as a sage, and asked to give his teachings in exchange for passage. He left behind the Tao Te Ching.</p><p>Some accounts are that he retired into nature, to contemplate the divine, away from the recursive heartbreaks of society. But others say that he travelled far into the West, to Greece or the Middle East, and there, five centuries before Christ, planted some perennial wisdom that took epochs to flower.</p><div
