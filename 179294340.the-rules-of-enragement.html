You feel it. I feel it. Everyone feels it.</h1><p>The system is broken, and we all know it. The people in charge keep telling us everything is fine while our cities crumble, our neighbors sleep on the streets, and our collective resources vanish into private bank accounts. They offer us dashboards, <a href="https://www.arkatechture.com/blog/what-is-anecdata-the-latest-buzzword-you-need-to-know">anecdata</a>, and out of touch IG stories about progress while denying what we can see with our own eyes.</p><p>This rage is not wrong. It is appropriate. It is the only sane response to insanity masquerading as governance.</p><p>But rage alone will not save us. Rage without direction becomes the very authoritarianism we’re trying to escape. History is littered with movements that began in righteous anger and ended in ash. The question is not whether to be enraged—the question is what we do with that enragement.</p><p><strong>Can we turn our rage into rules? Our fury into structure? Our demand for accountability into a blueprint for creation?</strong></p><p>This is the work of what I call The Politics of Now: learning to play the game of power well enough to change its rules. Not to opt out. Not to burn it all down and hope something better grows from the rubble. But to alchemize our collective rage into something that can actually birth a new world.</p><p>The politics that govern the establishment Democratic Party, and the Mayor’s Office in Nashville, have failed. They have failed because they do not learn from their failures. Conservative authoritarianism is filling that vacuum, offering the seductive simplicity of strongmen, scapegoats, and schadenfreude in place of solutions.</p><p><strong>There is a third way. A way that embraces the reality of power while refusing to fetishize it. A way that channels enragement into engagement.</strong></p><p>But to get there, we need to know where we are.</p><h2>What is the politics we are trapped inside of?</h2><p>To overcome a thing, we must first name it.</p><p>We’re swimming in political water so pervasive, so perfectly matched to our body temperature, that we can’t feel it anymore. We’ve been told this tank is the entire ocean—that these walls define the limits of what’s possible.</p><p>But we weren’t born to be aquarium fish, our smallness feeding our captors sense of importance. They’ve convinced themselves that keeping us dependent is compassion—that we’d die without their tank, their rules, their careful rationing of industrially processed food pellets and oxygenated tap water. Our need for them becomes their moral entitlement to us.</p><p>But we were born for the open ocean. To get back there, we first need to know where we are. We are inside the dying days of <strong>Neoliberalism</strong>. It’s death rattle before it heaves over, a kaiju that will vindictively crush cities as it collapses in defeat. It will never fully die, however, until the alternative that emerges from the ashes of the world it built (and destroyed).</p><p>Neoliberalism, as we’ll define it, is what happens when you run government like a corporation. It looks like this:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Privatization over public investment</strong> - Private companies provide services that used to be public goods, extracting profit from basic needs while public institutions are systematically starved of resources and declared failures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metrics over meaning</strong> - Everything gets reduced to “key performance indicators” and efficiency scores, even when what matters most can’t be measured. Numbers replace nuance, dashboards replace democracy.</p></li><li><p><strong>GDP over people</strong> - The goal becomes growing the economy, regardless of who captures those gains or who gets left behind. A rising tide that lifts only yachts while claiming to float all boats.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autocracy over democracy</strong> - Decisions flow top-down through hire/fire authority, with no democratic accountability for workers or communities. The boss decides; your job is to execute or exit. But this is already an advanced analysis of how things operate within neoliberalism. On its surface it is replete with advisory boards, public comment periods, community engagement panels. But beneath labry</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Justice as hierarchy enforcement</strong> - They colonize the language of social justice to argue that collective decision-making leads to bigotry, never acknowledging that systemic oppression flows from concentrated power, not democratic participation. The threat they claim to fight—unqualified voices in power—is precisely what they’ve created. But when those in power have the right signifiers, education and class, they always “know better” than those who are actually impacted by their decisions. <br><br>They float the specter of yesterday’s hooded bigots to obscure from themselves that <em>they are today’s segregators</em>, their failures setting the stage for tiki torch reactionaries to take power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deeply, fundamentally uncool</strong> - Neoliberalism wields power without the fetishistic thrill that conservatism enjoys or the revolutionary eroticism that animates the Left. It’s a political agenda of “well, actually” loserdome with no poetry, no passion, no vision—just the cold promise that if you get the degree, master the jargon, you can watch human suffering become PowerPoint slides and vacation in Napa.</p></li></ul><p>The problem isn’t just that this produces bad outcomes. The problem is that when it fails—and it fails, like most companies, more often than it succeeds —the people running these systems can’t see it. They’d rather blame the metrics, adjust the dashboard, and keep the system intact than admit the whole framework is broken. The final analysis, at the end of every consultant’s report, is not that more genuine democratic oversight is needed, but that full control by <em>the right people</em> hasn’t yet been achieved.</p><p>The neoliberal dream of systems made of logical, concrete inflows and outflows, that does not exist. It elements, concretized into ArcGIS and Tableau datasets, evade actual examination. The facts of the world, when turned into facts, morph into illusions. Metrics made into targets stop being reliable metrics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a> is to governance theory as Heisenburg’s Uncertainty Principle is to Quantum Physics. But instead of using this paradox to build a new philosophy of governing, it is brushed aside as a truth too inconvenient to admit.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lqnh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lqnh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lqnh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lqnh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lqnh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg" width="295" height="321" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/979e215e-a095-4ddc-9ec3-122b7c443f35_295x321.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:321,&quot;width&quot;:295,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\&quot;

They have skills we need: organizational capacity, institutional knowledge, access to resources, the ability to navigate bureaucratic systems.</p><p>But until they see the limits of their ideology, they are the greatest obstacle to achieving the values they claim to hold.</p><p>Why? Because they control most of the resources for change, but will only deploy them within frameworks that have already failed. They fund the soup kitchen but oppose rent control. They measure outcomes but miss the systems creating those outcomes. Worse, they colonize movements that threaten actual change—bringing foundation money and strategic planning until a community uprising becomes a 501(c)(3) with a logic model and funders that have priorities that don’t include actual systems change. </p><p>They cannot learn from their failures because learning would require seeing their entire framework as the problem. They will not see that their “expertise” has been part of the damage. That the people they’ve been trying to help have better answers than they do.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><br>“There is no reason to believe that bureaucrats and politicians, no matter how well meaning, are better at solving problems than the people on the spot, who have the strongest incentive to get the solution right.”<br><br>— Elinor Ostrom, 2009 Nobel Prize Winner for Economics</p></div><p>We need their skills. But they need to stop being tourists in other people’s suffering. They need to stop mistaking management for liberation. All we can do is stop letting them into our government, but at the same time invite them, invite them, invite them to the revolution. But invitations, to truly be invitations, require consent, and it is for them to prepare themselves to accept our invitation.</p><p>And the greatest battle, as always, is within oneself.</p><h2>The Politics of Now</h2><p>There is a new politics waiting to be born. It is here, it is everywhere. Waiting. </p><p>It includes people you might not expect. People who call themselves conservatives. People who call themselves leftists and progressives. People who’ve given up on labels entirely.</p><p>What they share isn’t ideology—it’s the willingness to look at what’s actually happening instead of pretending everything works the way we were told it should.</p><p>What they have in common is courage. The courage that unapologetic neoliberals do not have. The courage to see and speak the truth. The courage to not take human suffering and turn it into data to kept at arms length. The courage to be honest about what humans are experiencing, and to put the wellbeing of humans and the ecosystem that holds us above that of a fantasy rationally controllable system that they, in their heart of hearts, know does not exist.</p><p>The far Left and the Right share in their knowledge of the illusion of this reigning worldview, seeing clearly the emperor’s close were left back at city hall. The politics of the now doesn’t erase the real differences between Left and Right. Those differences matter, and their excessive applications will cause real harm. But it recognizes that both sides have something the neoliberal center does not: the ability to see that the current system is failing most of us.</p><p>The difference between the Right and Left in politics, until now, has been this:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Right</strong> tends to see everything as a game of social competition, and that wise people resign themselves to this cruel gamesmanship, and put themselves atop the pyramid.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Left</strong> tends to see the game of social competition as inherently inhumane, and that wise people should avoid participating by any means necessary and bring forth a utopia that has no pyramids.</p></li></ul><p>The Right-wing part of us fetishizes power. The Left-wing side of us abhors it. </p><p>What emerges when we embrace both these impulses?</p><p>I call that integration, that deep, exploding alchemy, <strong>The Politics of Now</strong>.</p><p>The Politics of Now knows how to square this circle, how to reconcile these opposing views of how the world should work. The Politics of Now sees that the world is a game of social competition. But only by playing the game can we change the rules, and make it a better place for everyone.</p><p>The Politics of Now are not the politics that exist in the world right now. But at the same time, they do exist, right now, in an unnameable potential state ready to explode into beinghood, at any moment, when the conditions are right.</p><p>These conditions follow the same stages that all things follow to come into being:</p><p><strong>Emergence:</strong> Sensing → Gathering → Acting</p><p><strong>Patterning:</strong> Holding → Shaping → Cycling</p><p><strong>Realization:</strong> Revealing → Aligning → Becoming</p><p>These are the nine stages that will cause the Politics of Now to emerge, spontaneously, and to endure, far longer than the brutish and short reign of neoliberalism. We can turn emergence principles these into rules—simple, prescriptive but also abstract, not to be followed blindly, but to be considered, interpreted and reinterpreted, operating in the background but changing everything around us in the foreground.</p><div><hr></div><h1>Emergence<br></h1><h2>Rule 1 — Treat possibility as real, even before it takes shape.</h2><p>The Politics of Now exists the way spring exists in February: technically absent, unmistakably present.</p><p>People feel the pressure drop before the storm appears on the horizon. Treat that pressure as information.</p><p>Act in ways that assume others, too, are carrying unvoiced discontent and half-born hope. When you behave as if the emerging world is already here, people stop hiding their own flickering versions of it. It’s less about faith and more about ecological awareness: the field is shifting; respond accordingly.</p><p>Potential becomes real when enough people stop waiting for proof.</p><h2>Rule 2 — Create spaces where people can see they’re not alone.</h2><p>Isolation is the great victory of neoliberal governance. They didn’t need to silence dissent—they only needed to scatter it.</p><p>So your first work is architectural: build the rooms, the circles, the rituals where private courage becomes public. A living room. A porch. A group chat. A weekly gathering where nobody has to pretend they’re satisfied.</p><p>These spaces don’t create solidarity; they reveal it. Once people witness each other’s quiet refusal, the field collapses into coherence. It turns out the thing we were all afraid to say was the thing we all believed.</p><h2>Rule 3 — Move before you’re sure.</h2><p>Movements don’t emerge fully formed; they assemble themselves through accumulated half-right steps. If you wait for clarity, you’ll wait forever. Clarity is what emerges from motion.</p><p>Start the imperfect thing. Try the experiment you’re not totally confident in. Let the group walk a few steps together, then look back and ask what worked.</p><p>This is how quantum particles behave, and how political energy behaves too: momentum reveals structure. The Politics of Now doesn’t reward the timid. It rewards the iterative.</p><h1>Patterning</h1><h2><br>Rule 4 — Protect the unmeasurables.</h2><p>Some values—trust, dignity, recognition—die the moment you pin them to a whiteboard. Neoliberalism’s compulsion to quantify everything is not a managerial tic; it’s an ontological mistake. The most important elements of collective life grow in the dark, like roots.</p><p>Measure what can be measured. Respect what can’t. Signal health through stories, rituals, and repeated human contact, not metrics. If dashboards ran civilizations well, we’d be living in utopia already.</p><p>Guard the soft stuff. It’s what holds the hard stuff together.</p><h2>Rule 5 — Surface the hidden commitments in the room.</h2><p>People don’t walk into political spaces as blank slates; they bring stowaway convictions, old injuries, forbidden hopes. If these stay hidden, they shape the group from the shadows. If they surface, they become material for world-building.</p><p>Name what you suspect is shaping the room—fear of conflict, internalized scarcity, learned helplessness, a belief that no one else truly cares. Say it gently. Invite others to confirm or revise it.</p><p>Collective honesty doesn’t feel like confession. It feels like the first deep breath the group has taken in years.</p><h2>Rule 6 — Make participation cheap, reversible, and rhythmic.</h2><p>Movements collapse when they demand too much too soon. They thrive when entry is soft, repeatable, and forgiving.</p><p>Give people low-cost doors: weekly gatherings, open calls, shared tasks with graceful exits. Let people try on the movement like a jacket, not commit to it like a mortgage.</p><p>And above all, create rhythm. Solidarity is shaped more by “We meet every Thursday” than “We have a five-year plan.” Pulse builds organism. Organism builds trust.</p><p></p><h1><strong>Realization</strong></h1><h2>Rule 7 — Build trust by revealing power, not hoarding it.</h2><p>Neoliberal institutions hide power behind a maze of procedures. Authoritarians hoard power to demonstrate their own gravity. The Politics of Now does the simplest, strangest, and most disarming thing: it names who can do what.</p><p>Make authority explicit. Make responsibilities transparent. Make decisions traceable. People don’t need power distributed equally—they need it distributed legibly.</p><p>In visible systems, trust accumulates. In opaque systems, resentment ferments. Choose the former.</p><h2>Rule 8 — Offer belonging before agreement.</h2><p>People don’t join a movement because they’ve reached intellectual consensus. They join because something in them feels recognized.</p><p>Do not ask newcomers to justify their presence or recite your doctrine. Let them belong to the group before the group belongs to them. Agreement will come—or it won’t—but solidarity has no prerequisite exam.</p><p>Build alignment around shared stakes, not identical theories. The Politics of Now is a coalition of the breathing, not the identical.</p><h2>Rule 9 — Center the future you’re building, not the enemies you’re fighting.</h2><p>Enragement is a spark; it cannot be the fuel. A movement defined only by its antagonists eventually becomes an artifact of them.</p><p>Hold the image of the emerging world with enough fidelity that others can picture themselves inside it. Describe a politics where people are not managed but met; where institutions behave like living systems instead of machines; where the horizon feels wider than the fear.</p><p>The future you evoke becomes the gravitational center. The phase transition happens when people feel, unmistakably, that a new world is not arriving someday—it is already coalescing beneath their feet.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Work Ahead</h2><p>These nine rules are not theory. They are not aspirational. They are the mechanics of how new worlds actually come into being—how rage becomes power, how scattered individuals become movements, how the impossible becomes inevitable.</p><p>The Politics of Now is already happening. In living rooms and co-working spaces where people are gathering to ask what comes next. In community meetings where residents refuse to be managed anymore. In organizing spaces where Left and Right realize they’re fighting the same fight, just from different sides of the battlefield. In every moment someone chooses to build rather than just burn.</p><p>Neoliberalism wants you to believe that change requires their permission, their expertise, their carefully calibrated pilot programs. They are wrong. Change requires what you already have: the ability to see what’s real, the courage to name it, and the willingness to act before you have all the answers.</p><p>They have the foundation grants and the Ivy League degrees. We have something better: a politics that doesn’t require you to pretend human suffering is a data problem. A movement that doesn’t make you choose between the thrill of power and the pull of justice. A future worth fighting for that actually feels worth living in.</p><p>The world we need is not waiting to be discovered. It is waiting to be chosen.</p><p>So here is the final invitation: Take these rules. Test them. Break them. Improve them. Share what you learn. Find the others who are also refusing to wait for permission. Build the rooms where people can stop pretending. Start the imperfect thing.</p><p>The phase transition is already underway. The question is not whether a new world is coming.</p><p>The question is: Will you help birth it? And honestly, why wouldn’t you? Being part of the <em>neoliberal problem</em> is just so deeply, deeply unsexy.</p>
