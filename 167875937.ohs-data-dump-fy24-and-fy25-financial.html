What is my life.</p><p>The last time I did this, for the Metro Arts Commission, a committee member overseeing that turbulent period told me: "it was one of the most helpful things anyone had done" in trying to sort through that mess.</p><p>It's in that spirit that I am publishing here the results of various public records requests that I have made over the past few months. First, some disclaimers.</p><p>I am not a private investigator. I am not a forensic accountant. I am quite bad with my own finances, if I am honest. To that end, I have not done a thorough write up of what I think any of this means. That's honestly not for me to say. In the below linked site, I've refrained from speculating what isn't in black &amp; white. At most, I've just identified areas that might deserve a <strong>closer look.</strong></p><p>Other cities, <a href="https://checkbook.atlantaga.gov/#!/year/All%20Years/explore/0-/vendor_name/STACY+HORN+KOCH/0-/department/EXECUTIVE+OFFICES/0-/division/EXE+CHIEF+OPERATING+OFFICER/0-barChart/account/CONSULTING+~+PROFESSIONAL+SERVICES/0-/project/DEFAULT/1/fund">like Atlanta</a>, have a data portal similar to what I built, allowing you see every invoice and which office it came from. There's nothing in TN or Nashville law that makes it more onerous to get transaction data, nor any real reason why you have to get it from the department you're investigating rather than the overall finance department.</p><p>All of these points of friction are places where the light of transparency can slip away. Whether it's hiding its mistakes, misappropriation, or intentional malfeasance, the knowledge that the public has not only the right but a reasonable expectation of seeing what you're doing with their money makes people think a little harder before they process an invoice.</p><p>If you'd like to forego any of the reformatting and layout choices I've used to present this information, the raw, unedited results of my public records requests can be found at this link.<br></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GrHbzX32wtFGoD5BblUQOAF_IsOf1IK7?usp=drive_link&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;OHS Public Records Requests Contents&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GrHbzX32wtFGoD5BblUQOAF_IsOf1IK7?usp=drive_link"><span>OHS Public Records Requests Contents</span></a></p><h2><br>What should we do with this information?</h2><p>Unlike Metro Arts, which had one board to govern the relatively small pool of grants that flowed through that department, homelessness has a more robust network of community groups that oversees the homelessness ecosystem in Nashville and, in theory, oversee the millions that flow into that network. Referred to collectively as a "Continuum of Care", there are various committees that operate under the authority of the operational board called the "Homelessness Planning Council" (HPC).</p><p>The different committees and working groups of the CoC and HPC are well suited to make heads or tails of what's in here, and any further documents that are released. I trust that this federated network of service providers that are close to the ground, close to the people this money is meant to serve, are best able to understand what these figures mean and don't mean.</p><p>For the most part, I consider much of my work on the financials done, with the first hurdle just obtaining the release of these records, something I have been seeking as far back as May 1.</p><p>In terms of collaborating on what to make of all this, I've added a tool to start a discussion on a given topic, either under your name or anonymously. But for the most part, I trust the community to figure out what to do next. And to inform our duly elected public servants what their marching orders are.</p><p>I am calling this release a "Community Audit", or perhaps the raw ingredients for one, because I believe strongly that when people follow clear sets of principles, collective intelligence can more effectively and ethically allocate resources than when they are controlled by a few insular groups.</p><p>And I'm not alone in this. As I've written about recently, Elinor Ostrom wrote about this very thing in her Nobel Prize winning work about the collective commons.</p><p>In her groundbreaking work Governing the Commons (1990), she challenged the notion that only privatization or top-down government control could prevent the overuse of shared resources. Instead, she demonstrated that communities can sustainably manage commons through collective self-governance, provided certain principles—like clear boundaries, participatory decision-making, and local accountability—are in place.</p><p>This idea forms the foundation of what I want to speak into being, a "Community Audit". It's built on the belief that open, transparent, and inclusive processes can lead to more ethical and effective resource management than insulated oversight. As Ostrom herself put it, “<a href="https://blogs.iu.edu/bicentennialblogs/2020/05/29/elinor-ostrom-an-uncommon-scholar/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">What we have ignored is what citizens can do and the importance of real involvement of the people involved — versus just having somebody in Washington … make a rule</a>.”</p><p>So without further ado, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ohs-community-audit/home?authuser=0">here is “Metro Nashville’s Office of Homeless Services, Unofficial Community Audit” platform. </a></p><p>Now its up to you.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/ohs-community-audit/home?authuser=0"

through the proper tool on hub.nashville.gov for The Office of Homeless Services (OHS) dating back to May 1. (There is a new tool to do this, by the way, which seems to no longer use Hub Nashville. You can access it <a href="https://nashvilletn.govqa.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(zm0zlyxmjorejpnutopl45bd))/supporthome.aspx">here</a>.) OHS’ lack of responsiveness has been a common theme in my research on them. I did not think it would extend to even state mandated public records requests.</p><p>It's worth noting that financial transaction records are about as "public" as public data gets. Tennessee has a very generous reading of public records, you can even request to come see records in person and the department more or less has to turn their computer monitor around and show you.</p><p>This data, this public data, data which when I worked in the Mayor's Office would have been a few taps away in the accounting software that scores of Metro Employees have access to, was exceptionally difficult to get out of OHS. It was orders of magnitude more difficult than from, for example, MNPD, which has responded promptly and effectively when I have submitted public information requests to them.</p><p>If their non-response to my public records request merely represents a poor execution of constituent services with nothing to be hidden, it is still in direct contravention of state law that requires response to public records requests within 7 days. They don't have to give you content within 7 days, but they need to just respond to you — and they did not. Not until I published their lack of action and submitted clear, graduated sanctions I would take until they aligned their behavior with state law. And only did they provide data to me and a Metro Council Member whose requests had been ignored for even longer than mine.</p><p>History of my public records requests to OHS. Some cancelled because Finance rerouted me to OHS, others were consolidated, but none that were directed to OHS were responded to within the allotted window state law allows until I publicized their non-compliance.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"
