<p>We are all through the looking glass when it comes to AI and virtually anything creative that involves a keyboard. But I haven’t come across a system that helps you succinctly explain to others how you used AI in that process. The etiquette and ethics feel pretty vague so far. And even as I can’t go to a coffee shop without overhearing someone offhandedly over-enunciating the syllables “Chat G…P...T…” or else referring to it as just “chat” or “Chad” (as a friend of a friend now calls it) — we don’t really know how to talk about our use of it.</p><p>I have a project I’m working on more art than journalism, and there’s a lot of research in it. I’ve been using OpenAI’s “Deep Research Tool” for it, and having it pull quotes from the original source. And then I’ve been checking the sources to be sure it’s doing it right — but I’m not striving to be 100% accurate (that’s just not the point of this project). </p><p>This is a very different use case than the original days of ChatGPT where you’d ask it to write you an essay on Blue Cheese and it’d make up half the facts. Even I’m checking its work, but I’m not comfortable with <em>not</em> saying I asked AI to do part of this research. </p><p>How do I disclose this? I want both <em>not</em> appear like I’m claiming this data is beyond reproach. But I’m also not just using these tools in their most unreliable “<a href="https://www.psypost.org/scholars-ai-isnt-hallucinating-its-bullshitting/">bullshitting</a>” mode. </p>
