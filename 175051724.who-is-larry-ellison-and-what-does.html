<h1><strong>The TechnoFutilist Doctrine Comes to Tennessee</strong></h1><p>Perhaps no one on earth better exemplifies what I call “TechnoFutilism” than Larry Ellison of Oracle. TechnoFutilism is, hopefully, the last great lash of modern humanity against the only inevitabilities that life has to offer us. </p><p>We are each given many blessings in this life, but, in the grand scheme of the cosmos, we must all inevitably endure suffering and death. But the TechnoFutilist disagrees. Death can be avoided. Suffering optimized away. And global safety? It only requires a well implemented centralized database.</p><blockquote><p>Death has never made any sense to me. How can a person be there and then just vanish, just not be there? Death makes me very angry.</p><p><a href="https://www.preachingtoday.com/illustrations/2021/january/larry-ellison-death-makes-me-angry.html">-Larry Ellison</a></p></blockquote><p>The TechnoFutilist is the Post-Modern Tantalus who thinks themselves the God Emperor, decked in a black turtleneck with a Tony Stark ‘stache.

But this relocation is not just about real estate or economic growth. Oracle moved to Austin in 2020 after nearly five decades in California. Something is prompting the quick relocation.</p><p>To my eye, the move has less to do with our wonderful music scene and healthcare industry and more to do with Larry Ellison’s half-century obsession with control through data. At the World Governments Summit in Dubai in February 2025, Ellison told Tony Blair: </p><blockquote><p><em>“I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can. We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it’s easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like. That’s the missing link.”</em> <br><br>(Fortune, Feb 14, 2025).</p></blockquote><p>And in a 2024 financial analyst meeting, Ellison made the social stakes clear: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on.”</em> <br>(Fortune, Sept 17, 2024). </p></blockquote><p>These are not offhand comments. They are the blueprint for the data citadel Oracle is now building in Tennessee.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>More than one million Uyghurs and other Muslims were abducted into as many as 1,200 state-run camps where they faced political indoctrination, forced renunciation of religion, and physical abuse. Survivors testified to threats of violence, forced drug intake, torture, and sexual assault … </p><p>Even as these atrocities unfolded, Oracle deepened its ties with Chinese resellers. In 2018—the year mass detention reports first surfaced—Oracle crowned Digital China its global “Partner of the Year.” That same partner marketed Oracle-powered “integrated policing platforms” designed for “strike, prevent, manage, and control” operations. </p></div><h1>The Road to Nashville, Or: <br>What’s so wrong with Texas?</h1><p>For nearly fifty years Oracle was based in California, home to the strongest consumer privacy protections in the U.S. In 2020, Oracle left for Austin, Texas. On paper, Texas looked perfect: low taxes, pro-business politics, a libertarian vibe.</p><p>In 2023, Texas and Tennessee both passed consumer protection laws that directly impacted Oracle. Texas adopted Attorney General-only enforcement (no private lawsuits) and a 30-day cure period before action. Importantly, Texas required companies to comply with formal legal process—subpoenas, court orders, official investigations—before sharing data with law enforcement. It was pretty lenient.</p><p>But Tennessee, never to be outdone in lack of oversight, said “<em>hold my whiskey.”</em></p><p>In 2023, Governor Bill Lee signed the Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA). No single provision made Tennessee unique—Virginia, Colorado, and other states had adopted similar language in various forms. But Tennessee assembled them into the extraordinarily permissive combination available:</p><ul><li><p>Banned private lawsuits entirely</p></li><li><p><strong>60-day grace period</strong> before enforcement—the 2nd longest in the nation</p></li><li><p>An “affirmative defense” for companies claiming compliance with voluntary standards like NIST</p></li><li><p>A <strong>processor/controller split</strong> borrowed from GDPR but stripped of meaningful oversight</p></li><li><p>And critically: carve-outs allowing data sharing with law enforcement based on a company’s own “reasonable and good faith belief” rather than formal legal process</p></li></ul><p>Individually, none of these provisions were unprecedented. <strong>Together, they created something new: a regulatory environment where a data processor could operate with maximum autonomy and minimum accountability.</strong></p><h2>The Processor Loophole</h2><p>TIPA distinguishes between data “controllers”— e.g. hospitals, retailers, insurers who interact with consumers—and “processors”—infrastructure vendors like Oracle who run the databases and cloud systems. Controllers carry consumer-facing responsibilities. Processors get narrower duties and more protection.</p><p>Oracle specifically identifies itself in customer facing documents with this exact framing. As per its “<a href="https://www.oracle.com/contracts/docs/data-processing-agreement-oracle-services-081425.pdf">Data Processing Agreement for Oracle Services</a>” dated August 14, 2025, “You are a Controller and Oracle is a Processor for the Processing of Personal Information as part of the provision of the Services.”</p><p>When TN was discussing TIPA in House and Senate hearings, Oracle’s own trade group, BSA | The Software Alliance (where it holds a board seat), submitted letters asking for exactly this type of terminology. The below letter was submitted in support of Sen. Bo Watson’s Senate version of the bill, introduced on 01/04/2023 and soon followed by a House version on 01/31/2023.</p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substack.com/img/attachment_icon.svg"></image><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">Letter To Sen Watson</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">171KB ∙ PDF file</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/api/v1/file/196c8042-45d9-4ff7-ac9e-59c6cf725f7f.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/api/v1/file/196c8042-45d9-4ff7-ac9e-59c6cf725f7f.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div><p>BSA | Software Alliance submitted this letter of support for his legislation, stating that it succeeded in: “recognizing the unique role of data processors and creating privacy protections that are interoperable with other state laws.”</p><p>Privacy scholars call the stark separation between “controllers” and “processors” a “protection gap.” It mirrors language used in EU data regulating GDPR language, but often lacks the teeth of the EU standards.</p><p>In practice, ‘data processors’ aren’t powerless bystanders. They can, intentionally or not, often read data, share it, analyze it, even delete or corrupt it. But in the way laws like the Tennessee Information Protection Act frames it, they’re couched as just <em>sitting in the background doing what the “data controller tell them to do.”</em> As we’ll explore in a moment, they may do <em>much more than that.</em></p><p>Tennessee didn’t invent any of these phrases or legal clauses. But whoever wrote our legislation seems to have cherry-picked the most business-friendly version of each one and assembled them into a package that gave data processors unprecedented latitude.</p><h2>Law Enforcement Collaboration</h2><p>Oracle wasn’t just moving offices. It was assembling the precise regulatory conditions under which a data processor could operate with maximum autonomy.</p><p>And in Nashville, it found them.</p><p>Tucked into the fine print<strong><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </strong>of  TIPA is something extraordinary:<strong> </strong>data controllers and processors may <em>“cooperate with law enforcement agencies”</em> whenever they believe the data they store might demonstrate unlawful activity. But actually, it’s not just “unlawful” behavior that entitles them to collaborate with law enforcement. The precise wording is: <em>“This part does not restrict a controller’s or processor’s ability to:”</em></p><blockquote><p><em>(3) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;</em></p></blockquote><p>TIPA meticulously defines 30 terms — but leaves “laws, rules, or regulations” completely undefined. Without definition, the phrase becomes infinitely elastic: could federal statutes, municipal ordinances, agency guidelines, tax codes, zoning rules, professional licensing requirements, even internal compliance policies qualify?</p><p>In practice, that gives infrastructure vendors extraordinary discretion to share data with law enforcement, even when the controller is the one with consumer-facing obligations. And these data processors have no obligation to let you know they’re doing this.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png" width="1436" height="562" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:562,&quot;width&quot;:1436,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:293350,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/175051724?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ekkR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa660035e-7de1-4c1e-b14c-f74f04ede13e_1436x562.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Tennessee Information Protection Act, went into effect July 2025</figcaption></figure></div><p>The contrast between the TN law (above) and the TX law (below) is startling.

discretion: processors can “cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations.”</p><p>TIPA formally enshrines plausible deniability. Processors claim passivity for accountability—”we just follow the controller’s instructions”—while exercising agency for law enforcement—”we reasonably believed this data might be relevant.” The processor role becomes whatever is most convenient: passive infrastructure when liability looms, active partner when they decide it is warranted.</p><div><hr></div><p>This bill was first introduced in the TN statehouse on 01/04/2023 by Sen. Bo Watson. I reached out to TN Sen. Watson asking about his reason for introducing this bill.</p><p>Sen. Watson replied:</p><blockquote><p>The bill was originally brought to me by Representative Johnny Garrett. Representative Garrett and I shared concerns about Tennesseans being able to protect their personal data.<br><br>Protection of individual’s personal data has become an important aspect in the online space. Individuals should have the ability to control the use of their personal data and platforms/businesses need to have rules to govern the use of that data.<br><br>As with all technology statutes this law will continue to develop with privacy protection as a focus.<br><br>Sen Watson</p></blockquote><p>Rep. Garrett, who sponsored the house version on 01/31/2023, did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but I will update if it is provided.</p><p>Senator Watson’s reasons for wanting to introduce a bill that allowed individuals to “control the use of their personal data” is noble. But it is hard to square with the actual law that was passed. Allowing data controllers and processors to “cooperate with law enforcement” based on “reasonable good faith belief” that something as innocuous as an undefined “rule” was broken <em>actually seems to weaken the public’s privacy protections.</em></p><p>Whatever its sponsors’ stated intentions, the facts speak clearly: TIPA appears tailor-made to the exact specifications that would allow a company like Oracle—a data processor whose leader has explicitly stated his goal is to aggregate power through consolidating data—to operate with minimal oversight. And Oracle and Larry Ellison have minced no words about what they want to do with that lack of oversight.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png" width="1422" height="1774" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1774,&quot;width&quot;:1422,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2607954,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/175051724?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NkZQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df0bf5a-86ea-4b1a-ad0d-79bfaa7aafe1_1422x1774.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p>The AI model needs to be provided with comprehensive data for context to predict outputs.

that provided a legal safe harbor for corporations <em>precisely like Oracle, </em>and the announcement they would be moving their HQ for the second time in 5 years. </p><p>When looking to how Oracle operates globally, its deep, <em>fundamental</em> relationship with the US intelligence services, and the trajectory of the United State’s co-mingling of surveillance capitalism and the surveillance state, the move to TN, with its extraordinarily lax rules on data sharing with law enforcement and protections for data processors, paints a darker picture of why they picked music city. </p><div

So let’s ask what we should always ask when crafting legislation that may apply to the 13th largest corporation in the world:</p><h1>What’s the Worst that Could Happen?</h1><h2><strong>Oracle’s Intelligence DNA</strong></h2><p>Oracle takes its name from a 1977 CIA project codename, and the CIA was Oracle’s first customer. From these beginnings, Oracle databases spread through U.S. defense and intelligence systems. By 2003, the federal government accounted for 23 percent of Oracle’s licensing revenue, roughly $2.5 billion annually. Today, according to Orcale’s marketing materials, 1,000+ public sector organizations and 100% of federal cabinet agencies rely on Oracle systems.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png" width="1214" height="1498" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1498,&quot;width&quot;:1214,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0eQy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16b60b12-2d44-410d-9bf4-3c130bfce480_1214x1498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The company now provides<a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/industries/public-sector/golden-dome-for-america.pdf"> accredited cloud regions</a> usable for Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information.

merely demonstrations of possibility — <em>“what our products could do if others built on top of them”</em> — and insisted they were <em>“aspirational business development ideas”</em> that <em>“do not

core Corporate Citizenship Values, including our Human Rights statement.”</em> Asked directly about slides showing police applications, she doubled down: <em>“We have no known implementation with a ‘Chinese Police Department’ … the definition of ‘use case’ is very different than an actual, implementable product or service, which Oracle does not have.”</em></p><p>Even where Oracle acknowledged ties, it was careful to limit the admission. The company conceded “limited authorized transactions with Xinjiang Public Security Bureau from 2011–2019,” but emphasized that it had not done business with the bureau since U.S. sanctions took effect. The message was consistent: Oracle may have marketed, demonstrated, and even sold its products, but it was not accountable for how they were applied by Chinese security services.</p><h3>The “Processor” Defense In Real Life</h3><p>This line of argument echoes almost perfectly the <strong>processor vs. controller framework</strong> baked into U.S. privacy laws. Under statutes like Tennessee’s <strong>Information Protection Act</strong>, a processor can claim it does not determine the “purpose and means” of data use — and therefore cannot be held responsible for outcomes. That burden falls on the controller. At the same time, Tennessee’s law explicitly allows processors to “cooperate with law enforcement” in good faith, creating space for them to hand over data when it suits their interests.</p><p>In China, Oracle claimed it was “just the platform,” disclaiming responsibility for surveillance outcomes. In Tennessee, the law now formalizes that very same shield: Oracle can both deny accountability to consumers and exercise discretion in sharing data with the state. In both settings, the company is able to present itself as neutral infrastructure, while still profiting from the uses its technology makes possible.</p><p>None of this is hidden information.</p><p>Nothing here is original reporting. None of this is more than a few clicks away on Google — and yet our leaders only seem to see the headlines about jobs, investment, and a glittering new campus on the East Bank. But at what cost? Tennessee and Nashville have already pledged hundreds of millions in state and local incentives (including $65M state and $175M Metro infrastructure), effectively subsidizing the construction of a data empire whose ambitions cut against both conservative suspicion of centralized power and liberal commitments to human rights.</p><p>And for what? A pedestrian bridge? Even the most generous reading — or willful misreading — of what Oracle intends to do with the world’s data in Nashville leaves little doubt that we are co-signing, and potentially profiting from, the surveillance of millions. If that investment ever “pays off,” it will do so by turning people into data points, monitored, optimized, and controlled.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

Home To Roost</h3><p>We have already seen what the collaboration of what companies like Oracle and state intelligence services looks like abroad. </p><p>In China, Oracle insisted it was only the processor, not the controller, as its databases and analytics were layered into policing platforms that targeted dissidents and disappeared Uyghurs into camps. In Tennessee, that same shield has now been written into law. Oracle can disclaim responsibility for how its systems are used, while still marketing their power to anyone with the budget and the will to build on top of them.</p><p>Which brings us to Nashville. What, precisely, do we think this will look like? What tools will be used to wage the “war on cities” the actual President has promised — with, we can only assume, the Shadow President of Silicon Valley providing the technical backbone?</p><p>The regulatory framework Tennessee has adopted effectively ensures that neither controllers nor processors face meaningful limits when it comes to law enforcement and intelligence access. By explicitly carving out exemptions that allow both parties to “comply” or “cooperate” with authorities outside of ordinary oversight, the law constructs a permissive environment where data flows toward state actors with little accountability. In practice, this makes it nearly impossible to erect safeguards against the emergence of a domestic surveillance state.</p><p>China has already provided the test run. There, Oracle and other Western firms presented themselves as neutral “platform providers” — distancing themselves from how police or security agencies deployed their tools — while actively marketing those very tools for predictive policing and repression. Tennessee’s statutory carve-outs replicate that same logic at the legal level: processors can disclaim responsibility while still facilitating the surveillance demands of government. The result is a regulatory structure that functionally endorses surveillance by default, making the construction of a broad, state-aligned data monitoring regime not just possible but almost inevitable.</p><p>Many people will say: “I’m not gonna knock someone for selling tools to people in another country. It’s not their fault what they do with those tools. And yeah, that’s what happens in an authoritarian state like China. But this is America.” </p><p>But, what, exactly, are we claiming <em>could never happen here?</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"
