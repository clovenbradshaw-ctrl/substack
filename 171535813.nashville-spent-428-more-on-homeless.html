A slow climb, followed by a sharp spike. Budgets ballooned. The Office of Homeless Services was invented and dramatically scaled up. Developers lined up and MDHA signed contracts for "permanent supportive housing."</p><p>You'd think with that level of input, we'd get some increase in output.</p><p>Think again.</p><p>Either this system is much more complicated than that and we're thinking about it too simply, or it's quite simple, and for some reason, we're vastly over complicating it. I think the reality is that it's both—and the federal government handed us the blueprint for exactly this outcome, and our local government and property developers were happy to do their part.</p><p>The truth is simple: The cure for homelessness is homes. The sickness is the business we've built around them.</p><p>In Nashville over the last five years, housing placements—the number of people who go from homeless to housed—are flat. That's according to the figures Metro's Office of Homeless Services publishes. Once we factor in a bump that came from COVID relief funds in 2021, they're practically identical year over year.</p><p>Look at the chart. The green bars shoot skyward. The housing outcomes? They flatline.</p><h2><strong>When the Math Doesn't Math</strong></h2><p>Here's what the data shows us when we zoom in on the first jump, 2020 to 2021:</p><p>In FY2021, Nashville's homelessness budget jumped 131%, from $8.8 million to $20.4 million.</p><p>Housing placements almost doubled. A 92% increase, from 975 people in FY2020 to 1,875 in FY2021.</p><p>That year, for once, the system did what the public imagines it's supposed to do: put more people in housing. Not because Metro suddenly found religion, but because federal COVID relief money came with actual requirements attached. Dollars had to be tied to putting unhoused people indoors. So, for one brief season, the numbers moved in relation to the funding put into the system.</p><p>It was proof of concept. Money can translate into housing. You can, believe it or not, just pay people's rent. 400+ people were rapidly housed, and all told, the housing placements doubled, and it did not cause the renter economy to collapse.</p><p>But when fifty million more dollars flowed into Nashville's system through the American Rescue Plan Act, this isn't what we did.</p><p>From FY2020 to FY2024, funding for homelessness related construction and programming more than quadrupled, with $46.6M flowing into homelessness related activities in 2024 passing through Metro Nashville.</p><p>Placements of unhoused people into permanent housing? Completely unchanged.</p><p>After the 2020 to 2021 spike, Nashville’s point-in-time count of homelessness went from 1,875 in FY2021 to 1,902 in FY2024. That's a statistically insignificant 1.4% increase. They even dropped between 2023 and 2024.</p><p>So what does that mean? We're spending a lot more to get the same output. In FY2021, it cost about $10,874 per person housed. By FY2024, that number ballooned to $24,491 per person housed.</p><p>Twice the cost, same result. That's the kind of stuff CEO's get fired for— an offense far more egregious than philandering at Coldplay concerts.</p><h2><strong>The Federal Blueprint for Failure</strong></h2><p>Here's what we need to understand: The Treasury Department created a two-tier system for accessing ARPA State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF). If you wanted to help people generally affected by the pandemic, you faced complex documentation requirements, geographic restrictions, and income verification hurdles. But if you claimed to be building "homeless housing"? The gates swung wide open.</p><p>Treasury gave homeless-focused projects <strong>presumptive eligibility</strong>—no need to prove pandemic impacts, reduced documentation, simplified approval. Developers quickly discovered this was the path of least resistance to federal money. Over 260 governments nationwide committed $3.8 billion specifically to homeless housing, with per-unit subsidies reaching $250,000 in places like Baltimore.</p><p>Nashville's pattern makes perfect sense through this lens. The money didn't fail to house people—it succeeded at what the federal structure actually incentivized: moving maximum dollars to developers through minimum regulatory friction.</p><h2><strong>The $25 Million Developer Dividend</strong></h2><p>When the city announced $25 million in "gap financing" for permanent supportive housing, the expectation was bold—deliver tangible results. Let's see what actually happened, according to OHS's own May 2025 report:</p><ul><li><p>Total awarded: $24,169,120.42 (with an additional $830,879.58 in MDHA administration fees)</p></li><li><p>Permanent supportive housing units created: <strong>182 total</strong></p></li><li><p>With Shelby House's withdrawal over "funding and housing concerns": <strong>168 units actually delivered</strong></p></li><li><p>Average subsidy per unit: <strong>$143,745</strong></p></li></ul><p>But wait—that's just counting the units actually funded with ARPA money. The reality is even worse. These developers are creating 930 total affordable units, but ARPA is only funding 182 of them. So Nashville is essentially subsidizing entire projects to get a fraction of the units.</p><p>Let's break down the actual cost per ARPA-funded unit: <strong>$24,169,120.42 ÷ 168 units = $143,863 per unit</strong></p><p>And remember: that's just the construction subsidy. Those units don't pay their own rent—you still need vouchers or other subsidies layered on top. The SLFRF rules specifically allowed this layering, enabling developers to stack federal funding streams.</p><p>Now compare that to vouchers directly. At about $15,000 per voucher-year, the same $24.17M could have housed: <strong>1,611 people immediately, for a full year, in existing housing</strong></p><p>Or flip it the other way: if instead of building, you took the same money and just paid the rent for 168 existing units, you'd cover: <strong>9.6 years of rent</strong></p><h2><strong>The Clearance Surge: What "Housing Surge" Really Meant</strong></h2><p>OHS's own encampment data tells the story they don't want to highlight. During the "housing surge," here's what actually happened:<br><br>Numbers not accurate</p><p><strong>From the camps they closed:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Brookmeade: 69 people displaced (45 initially reported + additional found)</p></li><li><p>Caldwell Park: 38 people displaced</p></li><li><p>TA Truck Stop: 38 people displaced</p></li><li><p>Hermitage Camp: 43 people displaced</p></li><li><p>Old Tent City: 74 people displaced</p></li></ul><p><strong>Total: 262 people displaced from just these five major closures</strong></p><p>And where did they go? The report shows:</p><ul><li><p>135 to permanent housing (51.5%)</p></li><li><p>71 still in Hospitality Hub interim housing</p></li><li><p>23 returned to homelessness</p></li><li><p>14 went to jail</p></li><li><p>7 died</p></li></ul><p>So during a period when we created 168 permanent supportive housing units with $24 million, we displaced 262 people from encampments. <strong>We displaced 1.5 people for every unit we created.</strong></p><p>The July 4th closures make the priorities explicit: 40 people removed from the East Bank "fireworks fallout zone." The message is clear: homeless people are obstacles to be cleared for special events, not humans needing homes.</p><h2><strong>The Damning Pattern</strong></h2><p>When you line up the charts, the pattern jumps out:</p><p><strong>Funding</strong>: 527% increase by FY2024 <strong>Placements</strong>: 195% of baseline (essentially flat after 2021) <strong>PIT Count</strong>: Hovering at 100% baseline<br> <strong>Encampment closures</strong>: Accelerating dramatically—336 people in 2023-2025 alone</p><p>That divergence—the year the inputs take off and the outputs stop moving—is the smoking gun.</p><p>This isn't failure. This is design. The system did what it was built to do in 202 1. Since then, it's gone back to what the SLFRF structure actually incentivized: moving money to developers while making homelessness invisible.</p><h2><strong>Having Our Cake and Leasing It Too</strong></h2><p>If we build into our system the principle that no one should be forced to live outdoors, then we're no longer simply talking about charity or social services. We're talking about setting a floor under the entire real estate market. We're saying that shelter is a right, not a speculative asset.</p><p>I don't think we all actually agree to that, though. As a whole, we are not willing to make the sacrifices that come with saying we believe housing is a human right. If shelter is the most basic human need, then this is modern society's original sin.</p><p>But here's the kicker: The federal government, through SLFRF, created a system that <strong>looks</strong> like it treats housing as a right while actually treating homelessness as a development opportunity. By making homeless housing the easiest way for developers to access federal funds—with presumptive eligibility, reduced documentation, and multiple funding streams—Treasury turned a humanitarian crisis into a housing development arbitrage opportunity.</p><p>The OHS report itself reveals the game: $7.5 million in "unobligated funds" from the gap financing program got transferred to the Barnes Fund, where it immediately went to a motel conversion creating 120 mixed-income units—but only 80 for homeless individuals. Even when the money doesn't get spent, it finds its way to developers.</p><p>Agreeing that everyone should have shelter changes everything. Because the moment we commit to that value, we're in direct conflict with an economy that has grown fat off of scarcity. Landlords, banks, hedge funds, REITs, and private equity firms don't profit when housing is abundant, accessible, and affordable—they profit when it is scarce, precarious, and leveraged.</p><p>So the question becomes: do we want an economy organized around the unfettered extraction of rent, or around the provision of shelter? Because we can't have both. And ARPA showed us which one we've actually chosen.</p><h2><strong>What the F*@% is Going on Here?</strong></h2><p>If you read the latest edition of the Nashville Scene and the cover story on Nashville's homelessness approach, you read my quote:</p><blockquote><p>OHS is working quite well, but its job is not what people think it is. From what I can tell, it's achieving its goal of removing visible homelessness by any means necessary. They just want to get people out of places as quickly as possible so they can't be seen.</p></blockquote><p>The OHS data proves this beyond doubt. Look at their own "Exit Destination" table: of 262 people displaced from camps, 135 went to permanent housing—a 51.5% "success rate" they'll tout. But that means <strong>127 people</strong> were shuffled into interim housing, returned to the streets, went to jail, or died.</p><p>Because this isn't some flippant critique. This isn't just far left vs. "progressive centrism," bleeding hearts vs. hardliners. This is about understanding how federal incentive structures laundered through local governments create the perfect conditions for what I would call “homelessness profiteering"—and how while we all might say we're against homelessness, the system is actually designed to profit from it.</p><h2><strong>The Dialectics of Homelessness</strong></h2><p>[Keep all five perspectives as originally written - they remain powerful as is]</p><p><strong>My family member who watches too much CNBC and calls himself a "day trader"</strong></p><p><strong>CNBC Guy</strong>: The shortage is about supply. Econ 101. We just don't have enough units. Let builders build, and affordability follows.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: But in cities that built aggressively—Seattle, Austin—rents still outpaced wages.</p><p><strong>CNBC Guy</strong>: Because demand exploded too. More jobs, more people. Prices rise when mouths outnumber meals.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: So the market builds for those with money, while the ones already priced out never catch up.</p><p><strong>CNBC Guy</strong>: True in the short run. But over time, luxury units "filter down."</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Filter down after how long? A decade? Two? What happens to the guy in the tent tonight?</p><p><strong>CNBC Guy</strong>: …That's the weak point, I'll admit. Waiting doesn't help him.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: So maybe supply matters, but only alongside something else—something that makes housing a right, not just an investment cycle.</p><p><strong>CNBC Guy</strong>: You're saying… like pulling part of the system out of the market? I hate the sound of that—but when I look at the guy on the street tonight, I don't see another option.</p><p><strong>My neighbor with the barking dog that's proud to be called a NIMBY</strong></p><p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: I don't oppose housing. I just don't want my neighborhood ruined. We worked hard for this. Don't we deserve to protect it?</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Protect it from what?</p><p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: From crime, from blight, from losing the value of what we built.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Are you maybe just afraid of seeing the neighborhood change? I don't see it becoming dangerous, I'm actually seeing it gentrify and people like you not being able to afford it. Is keeping people down on their luck out of your neighborhood just your way of protecting it? Something you actually can control?</p><p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: I'm not trying to put people on the street.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: But your status seems to depend on their exclusion. Maybe you can be one of the nouveau riche moving into a tall and skinny, but at least you're not one of those people.</p><p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: …That sounds harsher than I want it to be. I just want safety.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: But what if true safety isn't gates or zoning, but knowing everyone has a place to be?</p><p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: I mean, if everyone had housing as a guarantee, my neighborhood wouldn't be under threat, that's for sure.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Exactly.</p><p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: … Well I'm glad you see what I'm saying because I've always said it, protecting value isn't about walls. Maybe it's about making the world not a game of winners and losers, why can't we all be in it together?</p><p><strong>My friend the Advocate for the Unhoused Who Thinks the Best of Everyone</strong></p><p><strong>Advocate</strong>: Look, everyone wants fewer people outside. The question is: how?</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Do you really think the developer's ROI and the unhoused person's dignity are the same goal?</p><p><strong>Advocate</strong>: I want to believe that—because otherwise the coalition falls apart.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: What if the coalition is already false?</p><p><strong>Advocate</strong>: Then we've wasted years chasing compromise.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Are you willing to lose actually being effective to prevent your ego from being bruised? What if the real coalition is between everyone who believes housing is a human right—even if that excludes most developers?</p><p><strong>Advocate</strong>: You're saying: stop pretending profit and dignity align.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Yes. Be honest that the profit motive always puts itself before human dignity, that's what being "profit driven" means. When it's not, we just call it things like "financial sustainability." Naming the conflict makes it real, and we can only make progress in the realm of the real, using the logic of the possible.</p><p><strong>Advocate</strong>: …And the side we have to choose is decommodification, or else we'll never get past these contradictions. I need to sit with that. That's heavy.</p><p><strong>The Highly Intelligent Conservative I Studied Philosophy With in College</strong></p><p><strong>Think Tanker</strong>: The problem is regulation. Zoning, rent control, subsidies—they choke supply. Housing is a market. Free it, and affordability follows.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Deregulate, like finance? Healthcare? Energy?</p><p><strong>Think Tanker</strong>: Those are different. In housing, regulation is the main distortion.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: So public housing fails because it's public, vouchers fail because they're subsidies, rent control fails because it's a ceiling.</p><p><strong>Think Tanker</strong>: Correct. The only solution is market freedom.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Free for whom? Developers, or tenants?</p><p><strong>Think Tanker</strong>: Affordability comes from supply. Everything else is distortion.</p><p><strong>Me</strong>: Even when there are empty condos and people in tents two blocks apart?</p><p><strong>Think Tanker</strong>: [smiles] That's not the market's fault. That's just how it sorts people. Some belong inside, some don't. The condos aren't the problem. The tents are the proof.</p><p><strong>The Unhoused Person I Buy the Contributor From</strong></p><p>I hear all of you. Supply this, zoning that, ROI, coalitions, neighborhoods. You talk like there's some balance to be found, some win-win waiting around the corner. But while you argue, I'm trying to find a place that doesn't reek of piss to sleep tonight.</p><p>I've heard it all before: "build more and it'll trickle down." I don't have ten years to wait for that trickle. "Protect the neighborhood." From who—me? I've lived here longer than you. "Coalition." I've watched those meetings. The only thing that changes is the pastries on the table.</p><p>The only time the system worked was during COVID, when they just cut the damn checks. Then they stopped, and here we are again. Back on the sidewalk.</p><p>So let me tell you the truth: the only one of you I can stomach is the Think Tanker. Don't get me wrong—I hope there's a deep, hot circle of hell waiting for you. But at least you're honest about how you've designed this world. You don't dress it up in compassion or talk about "eventually." You admit it's dog eat dog, and some of us are meant to be eaten.</p><p>And that's why I almost respect it. Because the rest of you? You're just lying to yourselves while I rot out here.</p><h2><strong>The Arithmetic of Cruelty</strong></h2><p>Let's do the final accounting, using Nashville's own numbers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>262 people</strong> displaced from encampments during the "housing surge"</p></li><li><p><strong>168 units</strong> created with $24.17 million in gap financing</p></li><li><p><strong>$143,863</strong> per unit in construction subsidies alone</p></li><li><p><strong>127 people</strong> displaced but not permanently housed</p></li><li><p><strong>$34.5 million</strong> still unspent as of April 2025</p></li><li><p><strong>51.5%</strong> of displaced people housed—the rest scattered to the wind</p></li></ul><p>The system is working exactly as designed. The federal government created a homelessness-industrial complex through SLFRF, and Nashville bought in wholesale. Developers got their dividend. Politicians got their talking points. Tourism got its clean streets for July 4th.</p><p>And the people on the street? They got swept.</p><p>This isn't failure. This is design.</p><h2><strong>Next Time</strong></h2><p>Who designed things this way? The Treasury Department, with its two-tier SLFRF system that made homelessness profitable.</p><p>Where has it been designed differently? That's what we need to find out.</p>
