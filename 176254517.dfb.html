<h2>Making Metro Nashville’s Expenditure Data Understandable</h2><p>The raw expenditure data obtained through public records requests comes as a CSV file containing thousands of transactions with GL Account Strings like “01101109.501174.0.0.0.10101.001.0.0.0” - cryptic numerical codes that provide no context about which department made the purchase or what the expense was for. Each transaction includes amounts, dates, and vendor information, but without interpretation, these codes are meaningless for transparency or analysis. To make this data useful, we needed to decode Metro Nashville’s chart of accounts and map these numerical segments to human-readable department names and expense categories.</p><p>Metro Nashville uses a segmented chart of accounts structure where the GL Account String contains ten segments separated by periods. The first segment (position four from the right) contains the business unit code - a 7-8 digit identifier for the specific department or division responsible for the expenditure. The second segment contains the object code - a 6-digit number identifying the expense type. We extracted these mappings from the FY2026 Budget Book and other Metro budget documentation, identifying business units like “26110310” (Sheriff’s Office Administration) and object codes like “501101” (Regular Pay) and “501104” (Overtime Pay). We compiled this information into a structured JSON reference file (metro-data-structure.json) hosted on GitHub.</p><p>Given the large number of business units (several hundred across all departments and entities) and object codes (also in the hundreds), we used AI assistance to help extract and structure this reference data from the budget documents. While we believe this mapping is substantially accurate based on the FY26 budget book, we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy in the tagging. The volume of codes and the complexity of Metro’s organizational structure mean there may be errors or misinterpretations in our reference database. <strong>Anyone seeking to take action based on this data should always refer back to the original expenditure files and verify the coding with Metro’s official budget documentation.</strong></p><p>The HTML interface we built dynamically fetches this reference data and parses each transaction’s GL Account String to extract the business unit and object codes, then looks them up in our database to add “Department,” “Business Unit,” and “Object Description” columns. This transforms the raw numerical data into an interactive table where users can filter by department or expense type, with pivot tables showing spending patterns. However, users should treat this as an analytical tool for exploring patterns and trends, not as definitive proof for any specific claim about Metro spending. The underlying CSV files remain the authoritative source.</p>
