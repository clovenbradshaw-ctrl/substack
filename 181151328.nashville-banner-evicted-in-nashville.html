<p>Thank you to the Nashville Banner’s <strong><a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/author/mreiland/">Mikeie Honda Reiland</a></strong> for putting a human face and a systems analysis to what I’ll call the affordable-housing-to-eviction-pipeline in Nashville. And a huge thank you to <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;April Burns-Norris&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:215780761,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/573339f1-9310-4486-9e2c-1e96f5916355_144x144.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;8eecaa21-46fa-4ada-b239-92aa5fcaec60&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> for sharing her family’s story. I strongly believe that telling our human truth openly is the best way, <em>the only way</em>, to return humanity back into our community’s systems.</p><p>This story highlights why it is extraordinarily important that, if we want to design systems that are most incentivized to get good outcomes for the most people (rather than systems that are designed to continue to redistribute wealth to those who profit from un-housing people), we need those with lived experience of these problems to be central to our community’s solutions.</p><blockquote><p>There is no reason to believe that bureaucrats and politicians, no matter how well meaning, are better at solving problems than the people on the spot, who have the strongest incentive to get the solution right.</p><p><em>Elinor

trucks, Janaysia Norris felt waves of embarrassment.</p><p>She’d spent her childhood bouncing between Knoxville and Nashville, never staying in any apartment for too long. Here in Murfreesboro, in this rented condo, she’d finally found stability, or something like it. She’d gone to middle school five minutes away at Oakland, and plenty of her classmates lived in the same complex. She’d hosted sleepovers and made friends she saw regularly, taking joy in mundanity and routine, in little things like riding the bus together. Now in her freshman year of high school, Janaysia had lived here since fifth grade, the longest she’d ever stayed in any one home.</p><p>Descending from the bus, Janaysia hoped her friends wouldn’t notice what had become clear to her — that she and her mother, April, were being evicted.</p><p>April Norris remembered her heart breaking for Janaysia, for being caught off guard, unable to shield her daughter from the situation. As she recalled, all their stuff had been taken from their condo and tossed out on the lawn.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://nashvillebanner.com/product/donate/?campaign=701UN00000jsbQWYAY%20%E2%86%97" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg" width="306" height="255" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:306,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://nashvillebanner.com/product/donate/?campaign=701UN00000jsbQWYAY%20%E2%86%97&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BfMF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a22f2e1-0930-44cd-8403-2b3e8ac65eff_600x500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The following year was difficult for them both. For nine months, April lived out of her Hyundai Elantra while her legal challenge to the eviction meandered through the courts. Meanwhile, after more than a month out of school, Janaysia returned to Knoxville, where she alternated stays with different family members. Starting over was hard — everyone at her new high school already knew each other, had already built their shared history and rituals. She quickly got into a relationship, and her boyfriend became her sole lifeline. When that relationship ended, she felt like everyone took her ex’s side — before they met her, they’d been friends with him first.</p><p>Without a permanent home, without friends, her life had no sense of traction.</p><p>“She personalized being homeless,” April said. “Like it was her fault, or she felt ashamed. I don’t know if she thought people could tell, but as much as I tried to explain to her — like, ‘We’re not the only ones going through this’ — it didn’t help her in this situation.”</p><p>“I just kind of put a guard up ever since then,” Janaysia said. “I don’t like to associate with people that I don’t one-hundred-percent trust.”</p><p>After nine months, through Safe Haven Family Shelter, April moved into an efficiency apartment just south of the Nashville Zoo while she waited for a Section 8 voucher. Through it all, her daughter stayed close to her thoughts.</p><p>“I kind of felt like a failure,” April said, “Because I knew the effects of not having your own place to stay.” Throughout her own childhood, April estimated that she attended 12 different schools.</p><p>This all took place in 2018. Murfreesboro was the first time April experienced eviction. It wouldn’t be the last.</p><h3><strong>The hallway</strong></h3><p>It all happens in the hallway.</p><p>Just beyond the metal detectors, on benches and in nooks outside rooms 1A and 1B of Davidson County General Sessions Court — that’s as good a place as any to start a story about evictions in Nashville.</p><p>These two courtrooms run eviction dockets five days a week, alongside other civil matters. Each day, a little after 9 a.m., the court clerk reads out the names on the docket. As a group, everyone who’s shown up for their court date trudges into the hallway with the attorneys representing the landlords and apartment complexes. If neither landlord nor tenant has a lawyer — and if both parties agree — they meet with mediators from the Nashville Conflict Resolution Center. Any unresolved matters are returned to the courtroom for hearing by a rotating cast of judges.</p><p>On most days, the hallway is busier than the courtroom. One morning, the judge had nothing to do for a solid 20 minutes, so he pulled out his phone and showed his clerk photos of the Airbnb he’d booked for his upcoming vacation.</p><p>In this hallway, on a given morning, you could see a mother sit at the Legal Aid table and tell a story. Her daughter has been evicted for a noise complaint — that noise was her partner hitting her. You might see the daughter approach the table, with visible bruises.</p><p>On another day, you might hear yelling in the mediation room just inside the doors to Courtroom 1B. Someone is trying to evict their sibling. They want to work things out, but the resentment between them is deep-seated, stretching back to their childhood.

If you sat in the mediation rooms, more often than not, you’d see landlords who own two or three properties face-to-face with tenants, trying to work something out. You’ll see lawyers hammer out handwritten contracts with tenants, little agreed orders and payment plans scrawled on the back of printer paper. According to the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, in most cases, the tenant agrees to either pay a certain amount of money by a certain date — usually two weeks later — or vacate their home. Lawyers said they’ll take as little as $50 or $100, just a nominal amount. People usually leave without talking to the judge.</p><p>Mostly, people don’t show up at all. According to Legal Aid, the situation is “dire” — since the pandemic, about 1,200 evictions have been filed per month in Middle Tennessee, and at least half have resulted in default judgments. When the clerk reads the docket at the start of the day, if the defendant is absent, the lawyer representing the landlords will repeat the same thing, over and over: “Move for default.”</p><p>Beyond official filings, there are impromptu, informal evictions that are impossible to track. Moreover, most people who’ve been evicted don’t want to talk about what they’ve been through, about one of the worst days of their life.</p><p>And yet everyone involved — even the advocates — emphasizes that things often aren’t as simple as virtuous tenant, evil landlord. In many ways, even during a peak year for evictions, Nashville is working harder to address them than most other cities.</p><p>“I think Nashville’s doing a really good job,” said Anne Boatner, executive director of the Nashville Hispanic Bar Association (NHBA). “Nashville’s doing way more than lots of other [cities].”</p><h3><strong>‘A pretty banner year’</strong></h3><p>There is a single folding table in the hallway on the first floor of General Sessions Court that’s always occupied: the one staffed by the Eviction Right to Counsel (ERTC) program. ERTC is a collaboration between several nonprofit organizations. It does not automatically provide an attorney, but it does offer people facing eviction free legal services, mediation, and — in some cases — help with paying rent. After a successful pilot program from 2021 to 2023, it is funded through the Metro Council via pass-through money from the American Rescue Plan Act.</p><p>Soaring rents over the past few years are a common problem in these cases. Some advocates believe Nashville is verging on becoming some form of Aspen, Colo. minus the seasonality. In a tourism-driven city, the people who make things run can’t afford to live in the city proper — they have to move to the outskirts. Legal Aid believes the poverty line in Nashville is shifting, a wave rising to crash over the working class. This year, the NHBA said the city is on track for more eviction filings than it’s seen since the pandemic. One large, national apartment site <a href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/nashville-tn/">estimates the average 1-bedroom place</a> to go for $1,651 per month.</p><p>“2024 was a pretty banner year,” said Boatner. According to court data, there were 14,346 eviction filings in Davidson County throughout 2024. So far in 2025, there have been 13,768 evictions filed.</p><p>There are also countless “informal, insidious” evictions that the courts can’t track, according to Boatner. She says that these types of evictions often happen in South Nashville and Antioch, among immigrant communities — a landlord threatening to call ICE or cut off the water if a tenant doesn’t vacate, and people being scared to assert their rights because they’re undocumented.</p><p>“Tennessee is a state where landlords have a lot of power in terms of tenant rights,” Zane Jud of the Legal Aid Society, said. “In terms of lease agreements, all that jazz.”</p><p>According to Jud, there are eight attorneys in the city who do pro bono work on evictions. Legal Aid is able to help about 1,200 people with their cases each year — add in the 300 or so from the NHBA, and the ERTC program can handle approximately one month’s worth of eviction filings each year.</p><p>“A lot of times, in an eviction case, it’s just hard to win,” Jud said. “Success for us sometimes is just buying the tenant more time to find somewhere else to live.”</p><p>If the tenant hasn’t paid their rent, Jud says, a win is almost impossible. According to attorneys who represent landlords, there’s a misconception that you’ll receive a 30-day notice the first time you don’t pay your rent. But by Tennessee law, as soon as you don’t pay rent, if you’ve signed a lease, you are in breach. You may get zero days notice.</p><p>ERTC hired Stout, an independent firm, to run a <a href="https://las.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Final-Report-Stouts-Independent-Evaluation-of-Davidson-Countys-Eviction-Right-to-Counsel-Pilot_FINAL_2025.02.07.pdf">fiscal impact study</a> on its <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/03/24/nashville-eviction-right-counsel-program/">pilot program</a>. Stout said that for every dollar invested into the program, Metro residents saved somewhere between $2.60 and $5.10. Fully funding the program, Stout said, would cost $9.3 million annually. According to the report, at “full, sustainable implementation,” the program would serve approximately 4,500 households, or around one-third of eviction cases, and provide fiscal benefits between $33 and $44 million for Davidson County.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg" width="780" height="585" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:585,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KQS3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20e8aba3-df91-4fd6-a1cb-1e4c4f7bc457_780x585.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Judge Rachel Bell. Credit: Martin B. Cherry / Nashville Banner</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lisa Wooley of Rooftop Nashville, the ERTC organization in charge of rent assistance, estimated that it costs a little over $14,000 to keep someone in their house — possibly more in Nashville. She said it costs $30,000 to $45,000 in community funds and taxable money to keep someone in a shelter.</p><p>Right now, Jud said, the program has about $2.3 million in funding.</p><p>Boatner mentioned New York, which started the first right to counsel program in 2017. She cited <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/pdf/doi/10.1257/pandp.20251006">a recent study</a> that showed how even the existence of an RTC program provided mental health benefits for tenants, specifically for children.</p><p>In court, Jud said, if you don’t understand what’s going on when talking to a lawyer, you should avoid signing anything. An agreed order will enter the court system. You can’t really get an eviction expunged, and it may be hard to find housing afterwards.</p><p>“Have that trial,” Jud said. “Talk to a judge. But by signing that agreement, you don’t get to talk to the judge necessarily. An attorney, in [the evictee’s] mind, is a respected position, a person of authority. If you don’t understand, ask all the questions. Go ask the judge.”</p><p>Judge Rachel Bell — who started the first housing resource diversionary court in Tennessee, which has helped people stay in their homes since the pandemic — said an agreed order doesn’t always have to be fatal. She prefers “pay and stay” settlements whenever possible but said that agreed orders operate on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, if you comply, you can get your name changed to “John Doe” or “Jane Doe” in the system, voiding your record. But this isn’t an option if you agree to vacate, and the final authority rests with the judge.</p><p>“It’s more likely to happen if you’re a good tenant than if you’re a bad tenant.” she said.</p><p>Councilmember Zulfat Suara has a draft ordinance ready to try to write ERTC into Metro Law. Speaking to the <em>Banner</em>, she didn’t want to reveal too many details. But she’s excited about the prospects.</p><p>“This is gonna be on the very top of my accomplishments just because of the magnitude of the impact,” she said. “I’m just the lucky one to shepherd it into council and be the lead cheerleader for it.</p><p>“But it took a whole lot of people, and it’s good to have a mayor that is supportive, that believes this is something to keep funding.”</p><h3><strong>Unfinished business</strong></h3><p>Nashville’s ERTC program didn’t exist yet when April Norris was struggling for housing.</p><p>April had originally moved to Nashville from Knoxville in 2013. She was newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder, just released from the hospital, and one of the conditions for her release was intensive outpatient therapy. Nashville had better programs than Knoxville, so April packed up her things and left her hometown. Once April finished her therapy, she and Janaysia found their subsidized condo in Murfreesboro with an assist from a homelessness prevention program.</p><p>As April recalled, new developers had bought the property a few years earlier, received some tax credits and begun evictions. According to court filings, this rehabilitation was part of a “federally funded acquisition and rehabilitation program.” She began some advocacy work for her neighbors, and, as she recalled, her landlord didn’t like it and retaliated.</p><p>After the eviction, April pursued a lawsuit. Initially, she got her eviction dismissed and won a default judgement worth $25,000 through a countersuit in Rutherford County General Sessions Court, but each higher court ruled against her on appeal.</p><p>Living out of her car, April spent some nights parked in Walmart lots. Those were always busy, though, and on various occasions people tried to open her car’s doors. Instead, she began to park at hotels, waking up early to avoid any sort of trouble. During the day, she visited state parks, partly to drink in nature but mostly to use their bathrooms.</p><p>There are levels to homelessness, April said, and she realizes there is a level beyond living out of your car. She still remembers when a man rode up to her car on his bike.</p><p>“Can you watch this for me?” He asked her, then disappeared into an encampment in the woods.</p><p>Realizing where he was sleeping, April felt grateful to have the shelter of her Elantra. Still, one program she’d like to see from the city is a parking lot staffed by some security where people in their cars can regularly spend the night.</p><p>Once she moved into the efficiency with the help of Safe Haven, April said most tenants in her complex tried not to make waves. They wanted to keep their housing at all costs. In her apartment, she recalled, the water was cut off in the middle of the month. She said that mold dangled from her bathroom ceiling, which eventually fell through due to a leak.</p><p>She called the Department of Codes and Building Safety, which issued multiple violations. She said the landlord refused to fix it and took her to court. In court, she proposed to pay her rent into court escrow until the landlord fixed the issues. After another winding legal process with several escalations and appeals, she said, the ruling went against her.</p><p>Ultimately, April said, her voucher didn’t come through and she ended up evicted once more. It was February 2020, right before the COVID moratorium on evictions.</p><p>While she worked on her court case, April moved back into her Elantra, staying in hotels when she could afford it on her disability check. Her mental health was deteriorating — she felt like she was teetering on the edge of hospitalization. Meanwhile, in Knoxville, April’s father, Janaysia’s grandfather, withered away, terminally ill with prostate cancer and heading toward hospice care. He was paralyzed and needed a 24-hour aide, so April pressed pause on her court fight and drove east once more.</p><p>During this period, Janaysia was feeling utterly alone in Knoxville, battling depression to the point of self-harm. She’d come to stay in her mother’s efficiency in Nashville for a brief time, but she was still bouncing back and forth between the two cities. April was driving her to Murfreesboro for school to try to keep her in touch with old friends.</p><p>Later on, after her father’s death, April’s voucher came through the McNabb Center in Knoxville. Her grandmother’s estate — which included the house April’s father was living in — was probated. So she moved back to Nashville.</p><p>“I felt like there was unfinished business here,” she said.</p><p>When April arrived back in town, she stayed at the Salvation Army on Dickerson Pike. Through her room’s window, she could see the so-called “Batman Building,” the AT&amp;T Building at 333 Commerce Street. That image became something she clung to. Even in her situation, she realized, she could find little things to be grateful for.</p><p>“It’s mind over matter,” she said. “And sometimes, you have to make your mind go somewhere to take yourself away from all of what’s wrong.”</p><h3><strong>The other side</strong></h3><p>There are several corporate landlords in town whom Legal Aid referred to as “bad actors.” For the purposes of this story, they are the easy target, the cartoon villains stacking piles of cash in their lairs. Jud said that one of the biggest evictors in town is actually the Metro Development and Housing Agency, because there’s a constant waitlist for public housing and a constant stream of low-income people missing rent.</p><p>In most cases, though, said Faith Klein, director of civil mediation at NCRC, the mediators at court deal with pro se landlords who own fewer than five properties. They can’t afford an attorney, and they can only pay their mortgage if their tenant pays them rent. Lawyers who spoke to the <em>Banner</em> estimated that this category represents the majority in Middle Tennessee.</p><p>“What’s really cool about mediation is the landlord gets to sit face-to-face with their tenant,” Klein said. “And they get to see each other as humans. When I see these larger corporations that are taking people to court, there’s that loss of humanity and connection, because you’ve got someone at the top who’s making the decisions, and [they’re not] interfacing with the tenants.”</p><p>This summer, Klein recalled, a tenant had fallen behind on rent. Since the school year had ended, her daycare costs had gone up.</p><p>“I love my home,” she said, through tears. “I don’t want to leave. I really want to stay here if I can.”</p><p>“I have nothing against you,” her landlord said. “I would be so happy to keep you as a tenant, as long as you get caught up.”</p><p>They worked out a payment plan in which she added a little bit to each month’s rent over three months. Her sister moved in to help with childcare and rent, and as of this writing, she’s still in her home.</p><p>Klein shared the names of two property attorneys whom she respects and with whom she’s had positive experiences. A separate Metro employee who works to fight evictions said that while he was “not in the business of praising property attorneys,” he often sang the praises of these two lawyers because they had “the biggest hearts.” He estimated that between them, they handle about 25 percent of eviction cases on the docket. There are two main firms that handle the lion’s share, maybe 60 percent.</p><p>Both agreed to speak with the <em>Banner</em> on the condition of anonymity. They are referred to below as “Lawyer A” and “Lawyer B.”</p><p>As Lawyer A sees it, there are four buckets of people getting evicted in Middle Tennessee:</p><ul><li><p>People scamming the system</p></li><li><p>People with the ability to pay their bills who are irresponsible and buy and prioritize other things</p></li><li><p>People who truly need governmental assistance — maybe due to health, family or life reasons — because they will not be able to pay rent otherwise (the April and Janaysia bucket)</p></li><li><p>People who work and want to pay their bills but are living paycheck to paycheck, and some major event threw them off schedule</p></li></ul><p>She felt that too much funding goes into buckets one and two as opposed to buckets three and four. She also said that the fourth group is the largest, the majority of the folks they deal with. Her solution is one-off funding to help people get over the hump of their unforeseen obstacle, whether that’s losing their job or getting sick or their car breaking down. Rooftop Nashville provides this service within the ERTC program, and Catholic Charities and Metro Action also have some funds. Lawyer A would like to see more money involved, with some conditions and accountability. People would bring evidence of their emergency, then receive quick turnaround, one-shot financial injections to avoid court and predatory flex loans.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg" width="780" height="585" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:585,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rwae!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21100eee-4293-4746-b046-cc8bfcb75192_780x585.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Craig Holcomb of Legacy Court is set up at the courthouse. Credit: Martin B. Cherry / Nashville Banner</figcaption></figure></div><p>As you might expect, attorneys have different advice than Legal Aid in terms of navigating the eviction hallway. Lawyer B said that a court proceeding isn’t actually an eviction — getting a note from the sheriff and having your belongings thrown out on the lawn is an eviction. Between these two events, he said, you should leave on your own, try to settle the case favorably within 60 days and find other housing if you can. Then, if a new landlord asks if you were evicted, you can say that a case was brought, but no, you weren’t actually evicted.</p><p>After you leave, he said, if you owe a debt, call your landlord once you get even a little bit of money. There’s a reasonable chance they will settle for less than what you owe. Then you can at least keep the eviction off your credit report.</p><p>“Communication with your landlord is worth its weight in gold,” said Lawyer A.</p><p>Both lawyers emphasized that most people lack access to financial literacy. Lawyer B said that on every payment plan he’s ever offered, he’s provided a note at the bottom of the sheet. If a tenant calls his office, he offers to pay for half of their initial tuition of Dave Ramsey’s Financial Peace University and to reimburse the other half once they complete the course. A $40 upfront cost and required computer access are likely prohibitive in some cases. Still, in over a decade of doing this work, he’s only had two people contact him about the offer.</p><p>Lawyer B also said that if there is an eviction case brought against you, call the lawyer’s office first. In all likelihood, if you show up to court, you will work out some sort of agreement in the hallway. If you call the lawyer, you can often make that agreement over the phone and avoid missing a day of work and paying for parking. You can try to work out a settlement, a “pay and stay” agreement.</p><p>Yes, Lawyer A and Lawyer B are well-compensated. But anyone who does their job can start to feel worn down. They are what the writers of “Succession” might call “pain sponges” — over and over, they interact with people on the worst days of their lives, standing in the hallway, listening to stories and laying out options people probably don’t want to hear.</p><p>Both lawyers commented on the physical layout of the hallway as a hindrance. They used to be able to use conference rooms to give tenants more personalized attention. Now, when they walk out of the courtroom with 10 or 15 people, they try to go to the stairway, the only place that offers some degree of privacy. The Rutherford County courthouse, for all the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-kids-of-rutherford-county-reporters-essay">faults in its justice system</a>, at least has private conference rooms.</p><p>“There’s no place to give somebody dignity in that hallway,” Lawyer A said.</p><h3><strong>‘We’re not meant to be alone’</strong></h3><p>Near the end of high school, Janaysia started to turn a corner. April got in touch with the Emerald Youth Foundation in Knoxville, and Janaysia met therapists and mentors who still play a role in her life. Somehow, she graduated from high school with honors.</p><p>“Imagine what could’ve happened,” April said, “Had we had stable housing.”</p><p>Janaysia is now a senior psychology major at the University of the Cumberlands in Kentucky. Each fall, she’s made the Dean’s List. By her own admission, she remains guarded, but she’s also broken out of her shell as an RA in the dorms.</p><p>“Seeing my mom go through mental struggles and going through them myself in high school.” she said. “[Psychology] kind of helped me understand myself more, and also how to connect with other people. And how we’re not meant to be alone.”</p><p>She’s filling out graduate school applications, hoping to become a school counselor one day. She worked at summer camps throughout college. She applied to MTSU, and if she gets in, she’ll come stay with her mom in Nashville, hopefully working as a case manager on the side.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg" width="780" height="585" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:585,&quot;width&quot;:780,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qaa7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5700cd05-617c-4310-9da9-bf3e8180349f_780x585.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The table is set for Thanksgiving at April Norris’ home.

She rents a duplex in Hermitage that she loves — there’s a deck in the back facing some woods, filled with redbirds in the summer, where she meditates and does her advocacy work. When she thinks back on her own housing issues, what she recalls most is how alone she felt. She’s started an organization called Community Bridges to help people going through the same thing.</p><p>A year on, neither April nor Janaysia has fully unpacked. There are boxes of belongings in the middle of the kitchen.</p><p>“After being homeless so many times,” April said, “You’re almost scared to settle. Like something else is going to happen.</p><p>“It really takes a while to let that sink in.”</p><p>Janaysia came home from college for Thanksgiving. April bought a HoneyBaked Ham and cooked a whole spread of sides — stuffing, mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. They sat on the couch, caught up on “Stranger Things” and watched Kevin Hart’s new special.</p><p>At the end of the break, Janaysia slipped out of the house and returned to Kentucky, ready once more to face down the world. Her mother stayed behind to do the same.</p><p></p>
