When people accuse you of acting in bad faith or doing things for the wrong reasons, this doesn't resonate with your perceived reality. </p><p>It’s only when you open yourself to feedback from others, and accept their lived experience as equally valid as your own, that you can see you’ve done harm. One of the first rules in group therapy is that its not about <em>intent</em>, it’s about <em>impact</em>. And the same is only more true in governance.</p><p>Like most people, I have the equivalent of a self guided undergraduate minor in criminal psychology from listening to true crime podcasts. One thing I've picked up on is that virtually none of the people who harm others perceive themselves as doing so from a place of ill intent.</p><p>The one exception I ever really found was Anna Delvey, the fake heiress. When asked to explain her actions, she said, "Look, I'm just not a good person."</p><p>There's something disarming and kind of deeply baller about someone being able to say this about themselves. What that thing is, I think, is that it reflects self-knowledge.</p><h3>What's Missing in Nashville</h3><p>Self-knowledge, that's what I see deeply missing in local leaders who are enacting—whether through their own accord or through those acting through them—a concerted effort to broaden the strong mayoral system in Nashville. </p><p>This effort circumvents due diligence, the democratic feedback loops of boards and commissions, and keeps  themselves exclusively in charge of public commodities like our homelessness serving system and our emergency management system.</p><p>I fully believe these efforts come, initially at least, from a place of good faith. But acting initially in good faith but getting bad results and then not changing is, I’d argue, the definition of bad faith.</p><p>I am fully confident that the people who think they know what's best, because they went to the right schools and make the right connections, see themselves as holding back the "barbarians of chaos" that they perceive the public to be.</p><p>This is classic “level blindness,” mistaking what is more advanced, more efficient, and “above” the level you're operating at for the less effective, more chaotic lower level you’re “fighting against.”</p><p>I get that in asking for transparency and accountability, for distributed decision making and legitimate feedback loops, all of this sounds to those clinging to a top down version of power as a bad faith attempt to find ways to discredit them and tear down <em>this thing of ours</em>.</p><p>Speaking for those of us across the political spectrum who recognize the danger of an unchecked executive, it's exhausting to watch this pattern play out. Our leaders consolidate power, reject accountability, then dismiss any criticism as bad faith attacks from people who are 'out to get them.'</p><p>But here's what they don't understand: This isn't personal. We don't care about <em>them</em> as individuals. We care about what they're <em>doing</em> to our governance systems. Their defensive reactions reveal how they've confused legitimate criticism of their actions with personal attacks—a classic sign of someone who has merged their identity with their position of power. And on top of being dangerous, its just so… <em>boring.</em></p><p>Ruling autocratically and without keeping an eye always on consent is as bad an idea in Washington as it is in Nashville. It's as prone to violence in the boardroom as it is in the bedroom.</p><p>But humanity, ethics, morality aside, perhaps the problem that will cut through is that it <em>just doesn't work.</em></p><h3>Why Rigid Hierarchies Fail</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png" width="1200" height="909.375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:776,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KAgn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fbddf2b-3d5e-4768-8339-bc33005f1d42_1024x776.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Via Frederic Laloux’s “Reinventing Organisations”</figcaption></figure></div><p>Rigid, brittle, siloed hierarchies do not efficiently use common resources. This has nothing to do with political ideology—it's not a left-right issue. <strong>It is an up-down issue.</strong> </p><p>Pushing for top down control over all things reflects a very low-level understanding of how complex systems operate. It's not how any organic systems operate. It requires an incredible amount of energy to maintain the power imbalance, directing energy and attention at defending the status quo, at gaslighting inside and outside critics, <em>no actually everything IS fine. </em>What they’re defending isn’t really their outcomes (because they try extremely hard to never actually see what those are), it’s their status and authority to be the one at the center of it all. All of this is energy, time and money lost, not spent actually performing the core functions of the system.</p><p>It’s cruel, an inefficient and dangerous and mean, but again, perhaps worst of all, <em>just so damn boring.</em></p><p>As we move up the spiral of complexity in how things <em>actually work in the universe</em>, we do not see more consolidation of power. We see, in global trends towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remunicipalization">remunicipalization</a> and research looking at what actually gets better results, when we look at what Nobel Prize-winning economist Eleanor Ostrom observed: nested hierarchies governed contextually by those who are most invested in getting things right <em>is what makes things work better.</em></p><p>Complex systems that actually work don't centralize power—they distribute it to those closest to the problems who have the most stake in solving them</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><h2><strong>Read Deeper</strong></h2><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a></strong>, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, identified <strong>8 core design principles</strong> for stable management of common pool resources through her extensive field research of successful collective resource systems worldwide:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Clearly Defined Boundaries</strong> - Both the resource boundaries and who has rights to use them must be clear</p></li><li><p><strong>Congruence Between Rules and Local Conditions</strong> - Appropriation and provision rules match local needs and conditions (not one-size-fits-all)</p></li><li><p><strong>Collective-Choice Arrangements</strong> - Most individuals affected by operational rules can participate in modifying them</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Monitors who actively audit resource conditions and user behavior are accountable to the users (or are the users themselves)</p></li><li><p><strong>Graduated Sanctions</strong> - Users who violate rules receive graduated sanctions depending on severity and context</p></li><li><p><strong>Conflict-Resolution Mechanisms</strong> - Users have rapid access to low-cost local arenas to resolve conflicts</p></li><li><p><strong>Recognition of Rights to Organize</strong> - The rights of users to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities</p></li><li><p><strong>Nested Enterprises</strong> (for larger systems) - Appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Key Themes She Observed:</strong></h4><p><strong>Polycentric governance</strong> - Multiple centers of authority at different scales</p><p><strong>Local knowledge matters</strong> - Those closest to the resource understand it best</p><p><strong>Trust and reciprocity</strong> - Built through repeated interactions and clear rules</p><p><strong>Adaptive management</strong> - Rules evolve based on feedback and changing conditions</p><p><strong>Self-governance works</strong> - Communities can manage resources without privatization or top-down control</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p></p><p>Similar to the breakthroughs in AI systems that are revolutionizing automation, models that use “MoE” or “Mixtures of Experts”, it is far more efficient to leverage a contextual part of the inference stack, trained on a particular topic, than to run all problems through the full, centralized model.</p><p>The extreme of the Strong Mayor model, which by some accounts the current administration is undergoing changes to boards and commissions structures to move further towards, isn't grounded in any sort of robust political systems theory.</p><p>Its logic only makes sense when you look at how the state is taking away much of TN Mayors’ perceived power, and Mayors they are, across administrations, <em>clawing power back from somewhere.</em> But this is not a way to run a well functioning city. It’s just low-complexity centralization flowing downwards, the bullied in turn becoming bullies. </p><p>Is anyone brave enough to break the cycle?</p><p>The fact is: there is nothing that indicates that a central authority can handle complex problems and resource allocation better than those most incentivized to get things right. We learned last century that this was a disaster on all levels and across all ideologies. It is bad to centralize power in a right-wing fascist way, and it is bad to centralize power in left-wing authoritarian communist way. And to be clear, I say this as a loud and proud <em>socialist. </em></p><p>In local politics, your Left/Right leaning doesn’t matter as much as your Up/Down, which determines whether power is controlled centrally (down) or collectively (up).</p><p>And when we look at two of the systems our Mayor’s Office has direct and complete oversight over, with the sole autonomy to hold their leaders accountable, OHS and OEM are not case studies for Mayoral autonomy. In fact, they are glaring red flags being waved to get our attention and saying loudly <em>this isn't working!</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

governance overseen by contextual experts is how municipalities operate effectively. We could call this higher perspective—one that understands we need to create feedback loops at all scales within our systems to make things work more effectively—Municipalism. It's a perspective that transcends left-right culture war bullshit.</p><p>Then there's the other perspective, the one that I saw in full swing when I worked at the Mayor’s Office. I worked down the hall from the guy who processed all the board and commission nominees. If you had any suggestions for a vacancy, his first question to you was not: “Well, what do they know about sanitation?” Or “There’s a lot of directions our taxi board could go, what're their feelings on ride share unionization?” The first question was always the same: “Are they a Cooper person?”</p><p>I don't think anyone’s being asked if they're a “Cooper person” anymore before they get put on a board or commission. And they're hopefully not directly asked if they're an “O’Connell person.” </p><p>But what I'm seeing is that it’s not so much about who holds the seat, but the idea of what that seat should hold.</p><p>If Municipalism is the perspective that authority should be democratic, distributed, placed contextually with those most invested in getting things right, then the other perspective, the one that is just the city-level version of the same autocracy we're seeing in Washington—that asserts that a single executive is best positioned to decide all things—we can call this what it is: <em>Mayoronic</em>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"
