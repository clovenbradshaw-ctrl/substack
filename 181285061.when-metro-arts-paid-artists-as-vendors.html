<p>In June 2024, Metro Nashville’s Internal Audit Office found that Metro Arts had been paying individual artists through an invoice system as vendors rather than through grant agreements. The department was operating under a 2014 procurement approval for small artist payments that had grown outdated as award amounts increased. The consequence was swift and severe: complete program restructuring. Individual artists can no longer receive Thrive funding directly—they must now work through nonprofit fiscal sponsors.</p><p>The restructuring effectively shut down direct artist funding in Nashville. Many, including this blogger, believe the real driver wasn’t procurement concerns but that establishment arts organizations were upset that Thrive funding was becoming more progressive and equitable, directing money to diverse individual artists rather than the traditional organizations accustomed to receiving Metro Arts dollars.</p><p>Regardless of the underlying politics, Metro’s stated reason was clear: the payment mechanism violated procurement standards.</p><p>Yet through at least July 2025—over a year after Metro Arts was restructured—the Office of Homeless Services had paid seven landlords over $400,000 with no contracts, no procurement approval, and no accountability mechanisms.</p><p>In June 2025, OHS received $2.4 million to expand the program.</p><h2>The Double Standard</h2><p>Metro Arts was paying artists $10,000-$20,000 through invoices under a 2014 approval that covered amounts up to $4,000. The department had panel reviews, scoring rubrics, application tracking, and documented processes. Still, the payment mechanism was deemed improper. The entire department’s finances were frozen. The program was restructured.</p><p>Financial documents obtained by public records requests show that the Office of Homeless Services paid landlords $23,100 to $133,284 with no contracts, no approval, no documentation, and no oversight. Now, with Director Calvin’s “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing” program (now rebranded as Metro Rapid Rehousing Funds or “MRRF”), unless the department is similarly overhauled, it appears that this trend will continue.</p><h2>What OHS Actually Did</h2><p>Between July 2023 and June 2025, the Office of Homeless Services made the following payments through Landlord Engagement Funds, all exceeding Metro’s $25,000 competitive bidding threshold:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

triggers competitive bidding requirements under Metro’s Procurement Code. Searches of Metro’s contract databases found no executed contracts for any landlord. No procurement approval from the Purchasing Agent. No documentation of sole source or emergency purchase justification.</p><h2>The Arrangement: All Risk for Landlords &amp; Tenants, Zero for Metro</h2><p>OHS approached landlords with a pitch: sign 12-month leases with chronically homeless families, and Metro will pay the rent through “bridge funding” from ARPA dollars. The promise was verbal. No written contract existed between Metro and any landlord. The duration of how long rent would be paid beyond the landlord engagement varied.</p><p>According to Nashville Scene’s October 2024 investigation, housing providers have noted that rent payments “often came late or not at all.” Landlords initiated eviction proceedings against families OHS had placed. With no contract, landlords had no legal standing to hold Metro accountable for the promised payments.</p><p>Here is how this program has worked in practice:</p><p><strong>The landlord’s liability:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Signed binding 12-month lease contracts with vulnerable tenants based on Metro’s informal promises</p></li><li><p>When Metro payments stopped, landlords had to evict homeless families Metro placed</p></li><li><p>No legal recourse (no contract = no standing)</p></li><li><p>All financial risk: property damage, unpaid utilities, legal fees</p></li><li><p>No documentation of what Metro promised</p></li></ul><p><strong>What tenants’ experienced:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Often did not receive copies of their own leases (Metro retained them), according to a case manager and multiple tenants</p></li><li><p>Section 8 vouchers that never materialized or were so delayed landlords initiated evictions</p></li><li><p>Support services that disappeared when funding ended</p></li><li><p>Abandonment mid-lease</p></li><li><p>Evictions on their records. Incidents of this have been documented, with some judgements in excess of $15,000 being garnished from their wages</p></li></ul><p><strong>What Metro got:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Placement statistics for HUD reporting</p></li><li><p>Political credit for “addressing homelessness”</p></li><li><p>Zero contractual liability when arrangements failed</p></li><li><p>Zero accountability for outcomes</p></li></ul><h2>Metro Banned Purchase Splitting—OHS Kept Doing It</h2><p>On March 20, 2025, Metro <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/PSB-250320-Regulation-Change-1.pdf?ct=1741096544">updated its procurement regulations</a>, raising the competitive bidding threshold from $25,000 to $50,000 and adding explicit language: “Splitting of orders to remain below this threshold is prohibited.”</p><p>Five landlord arrangements continued receiving payments after March 20, 2025:</p><ul><li><p>Hillside Crossing: through June 2025</p></li><li><p>97 Wallace: through June 2025</p></li><li><p>The Ave Nashville: through June 2025</p></li><li><p>Freeman Webb: through June 2025</p></li><li><p>Extended Stay America: through June 2025</p></li></ul><p>The Jeffrey Wolff arrangements look like textbook splitting: Wolff Properties received $27,500 between October 2023 and February 2024. Jeffrey Wolff dba Bengal Property Management—the same individual operating under a different entity—received $34,500 between April and November 2024. Total: $62,000.<br><br>FACT CHECK TBD: </p><p>https://claude.ai/chat/13aa9b80-9129-4f74-ac1a-97832c6d6fad</p><h2>The Question</h2><p>Metro Arts was paying artists through an invoice system that Metro Finance claims, after 10 years without complaint, violated procurement standards. The program was restructured. Artists can no longer receive direct funding.</p><p>OHS paid landlords up to $133,284 each—all exceeding competitive bidding thresholds—with no contracts, no approval, and no accountability. People were placed. Money was late or didn’t show up at all. People have been evicted after being placed by the city and are paying back landlords through garnished wages (with interest). <strong>The program received $2.4 million to expand.</strong></p><p>It seems like there is one set of rules for struggling artists, many of whom can hardly make their rent. Yet there is another set of rules entirely for property owners who profit from homelessness—where contracts are optional, procurement thresholds are suggestions, and $416,000 in irregular payments merit expansion rather than the immediate corrective action and HIGH RISK findings that artists received for far less.</p>
