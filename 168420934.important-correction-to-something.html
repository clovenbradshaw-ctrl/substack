<p>An error was on my <a href="https://ndp.intelechia.com/">mini-site</a> that I sent out regarding details from the Downtown Library Garage explosion and fire. It mistakenly said there were injuries. There were no injuries, thankfully. I apologize for this misstatement and I am sending this to all who have opened that email since it went out. The site has been updated but I wanted to provide transparency that this error was made and is now corrected.<br><br>Thank you.</p>
