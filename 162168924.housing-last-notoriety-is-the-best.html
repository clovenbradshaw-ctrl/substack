He has the bearing of a Black anime nerd. He’s unhoused. He’s lived here for a few years, in the woods beside the Cumberland, among people who aren’t his family, but who know him. And that, I learn, is an important thing to be.</p><p>Miles balances an oddly shaped, bone-colored stick on his right shoulder for the hour we speak with him. It’s never acknowledged, and it swivels slowly back and forth like a sounding rod. It seems like something he’s just doing as a bit. But something tells me not to ask about it.</p><p>He knows exactly the scene in movies I’m talking about.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” he says with a knowing grin, his eyes wide to the present moment — he permanently has the look of someone rediscovering a place he once knew.</p><p>“Okay, so what are we looking at?” I ask him, and he leads us on a tour of Old Tent City, Nashville’s largest and oldest homeless encampment.</p><p>We hadn’t come there expecting to get a tour from him. We didn’t know him at all before he started walking alongside us as we strode intently through the debris and mud that cover the ground of this everyman’s land of city property. We were on a side quest from our main visit — we’d just heard some alarming news.</p><p>There was a dead body up by the train tracks.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>This has been a lot for me to process, and harder on my psyche than I expected. I thank those who’ve shared parts of their story with me, contributing to a tapestry I grateful we can weave. And I also thank, from the bottom of my heart, those who are support me emotionally as I try to make sense of all this, in my self and in this city.</p><p>Names changed when appropriate. Quotes will appear verbatim.</p></div><h1><strong>♫ Closing Time. You may not get a [permanent] home but you can’t… stay… here…</strong></h1><p></p><p></p><p>On March 31, Nashville’s Office of Homeless Services (OHS) informed the media that they would be closing Old Tent City (OTC). At least 120 people were informed that for their home, it was closing time.</p><p>Twenty-four days into the two-month closure plan, Miles walked my former boss Ron Johnson and me around OTC, giving us the equivalent of the <em>Mean Girls</em> cafeteria scene and telling us his story.</p><p>We’d come to build relationships with some of the more vocal OTC residents — the ones who, two days earlier, had undersigned a petition to Mayor O’Connell, published with help from the nonprofit<a href="https://opentablenashville.org/"> Open Table Nashville</a>.</p><p>Old Tent City is Nashville’s largest and oldest homeless encampment. It dates back to massive Reagan-era budget cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development — slashes to government services never repeated until now.</p><p>The land is owned by Metro Nashville, with the exception of the area just beneath I-24, which is controlled by TDOT. The 24-acre lot is unused public property but has been earmarked for an as-yet unfunded<a href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/parks/planning-and-special-projects/park-plans-and-projects/wharf-park-master-plan"> “Wharf Park”</a>. With a price tag estimated at $80M, Wharf Park is described in Metro Parks planning documents as “an opportunity to create great synergies between water-based programs, the site, and the community.”</p><p>The closure of the camp was long speculated but ultimately a closely guarded secret until the media was advised of it. This type of closed-door decision-making by the Metro Office of Homeless Services has drawn the ire of residents and service organizations alike, who argue that it does not follow best practices in conducting “housing surges.”</p><p><strong>Housing surges</strong> is the new term of art for “encampment closures.” The switch is a typical liberal euphemism — refocusing on what is purportedly being provided over what is being taken away.</p><p>The criticism is grounded. Supporters of the residents of Old Tent City point out the stark contrast between how OHS operates its “housing surges” and the best practices outlined in the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) guide,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250316231038/https://www.usich.gov/guidance-reports-data/federal-guidance-resources/19-strategies-communities-address-encampments"> </a><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250316231038/https://www.usich.gov/guidance-reports-data/federal-guidance-resources/19-strategies-communities-address-encampments">19 Strategies for Communities to Address Encampments Humanely and Effectively</a></em>, published in 2024.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>STRATEGY 1: Engage Encampment Residents in Efforts to Develop Solutions</strong></h3><blockquote><p>It is critical to connect early, often, transparently, and meaningfully with encampment residents, who understand better than any other people which services and outreach approaches work — and which do not. Engaging and including people living in encampments in policymaking, planning, and nearly every strategy of this guidance increases their likelihood of receiving the housing, health, and other support necessary to move off the streets and into housing or shelter while they await permanent housing.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>STRATEGY 5: Publicize Protocols</strong></h3><blockquote><p>To make evidence-based decisions that lead to effective, long-term outcomes, cities and counties should have clear, publicized protocols to guide when and how encampments will be closed.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>By keeping the camp closure a secret prior to its announcement — even from the Metro Council Member whose district it is in — OHS sidestepped at least strategies 1 and 5 for “humanely and effectively” addressing encampments.</p><p>In response, a petition to have a meeting with the Mayor was undersigned by 20 current and former residents of Old Tent City and published last week — similar to one submitted last September, when Metro authorities bulldozed electrified and fully plumbed multi-story DIY homes that were built on the riverside lot without permits.</p><p>You can read about the recent petition here:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/petition-from-old-tent-city-residents-urges-phased-closure-land-for-homeless-community?photo=2">FOX17 report</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2025/04/05/nashville-old-tent-city-homeless-encampments/82880677007/">Tennessean op-ed</a></p></li></ul><p>The petition is grounded in the reality that there simply is not enough permanent supportive housing in Nashville at this time for people to transition off the street. There’s an awareness, I read, that we’re all between a rock and a hard place — and closing a camp creates a game of whack-a-mole when the next camp, by the simple laws of supply and demand, inevitably forms.</p><blockquote><p><em>We see all the new people who are coming through. Campsites are being bulldozed everywhere. Where are people going? They come here. And what about the homeless they’ve put into housing who fall out? They need somewhere to go. We have friends going through that right now. What are the people supposed to do who aren’t on the list to get housing?</em></p></blockquote><p>The organizer and publisher of this petition,<a href="https://opentablenashville.org/"> Open Table Nashville</a>, whose stated goal is “to create a community with our friends to develop stability that moves people into permanent housing solutions,” has become persona non grata to power players in the homelessness ecosystem.</p><p>Two days after the release of the petition, in an Executive Committee meeting for the Homelessness Planning Council of Nashville’s Continuum of Care, some of the most powerful figures in Nashville’s homelessness system discussed the petition thusly:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Speaker 1:</strong> The Table [Open Table Nashville] is trying to get us to donate the land to the people. Is that a thing?</p><p><strong>Speaker 2:</strong> They want to do a whole petition. The saddest thing that bothers me the most about this situation is it's exploitation. Absolutely. Everyone down there says, <em>I want housing</em>. But when certain advocates get in their ear. They used to get in their ear to say, <em>no, I want to stay here</em>. Now they get in their ear to say, <em>we want these conditions</em>.</p></blockquote><p>My take is: there is some kind of childish telephone game, ideological gamesmanship, power hoarding, or just plain butt-hurt feelings getting in the way of being helpful — likely on many sides.</p><p>As Council Member Courtney Johnston put it to me:</p><blockquote><p><em>Can we just focus on the work instead of having these goofy ass turf wars and personality issues and whatever. Because while all this nitpicky and ego issues, quite frankly, you got people literally dying on the streets.</em></p></blockquote><p>So I went to Old Tent City myself. Without any mediation, with no outside tour guide to “get in my ear” — and I saw vividly and literally what she was talking about.</p><p>I’m not sure we agree on who is the driving force behind much of the “turf wars,” but I’m glad we agree they are “goofy ass.”</p><p>Ron Johnson, my old boss from the Mayor’s Office (and from the Oasis Center before that), came along for backup. And because I knew that turning over a rock on a complicated world-within-a-world that needs his help and unconditional love is the best gift I could give my old friend. I think I got him hooked, and I’m glad.</p><p>Because if there’s anyone who knows how to settle a turf war, it’s an ex-gangbanger who now teaches meditation.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>“Someone dead on the tracks.”</strong></h2><p></p><p></p><p>Ron and I were speaking with “Mama V,” one of the more vocal — in every sense of the word — advocates for the “home free” (a term I clocked Miles using and made a note of). Mama V lives in an RV, one of few in OTC with one, and her graduation from a tent to a rundown caravan is a point of pride.</p><p>Her husband proudly announces he’s had a full-time job since 2006. They live with seven dogs — “all got their shots up to date!” she tells us, to show her competency as an animal lover. And they have, like many folks in OTC, their extended set of “associates.”</p><p>Mama V was telling us her take on the Office of Homeless Services’ standing offer for all encampment residents to move into the Roadway Inn — a converted motel with 100+ units, being reserved exclusively for OTC residents for these two months.</p><blockquote><p>“Me personally,” she says between drags on her ever-present cigarette, “I don't like being in a place. I'm a country girl.”</p></blockquote><p>It takes me a moment to understand what “being in a place” means in this sense. Originally from West Virginia, Mama V seems accustomed to the RV/trailer lifestyle. OTC functions differently for her than it does for some of the other people living in tents and found-object constructions.</p><p>On a previous visit, I heard her discuss Tennessee’s longstanding “homesteading laws,” and she rattled off chapter and verse of Tennessee code, arguing that she may have a right to the land she was on under “adverse possession.”<br> Rev. Lindsey Krinks from<a href="https://opentablenashville.org/"> Open Table Nashville</a> listened politely to her theory but explained that a lawyer had reviewed the law for them and made it quite clear this wasn’t a reasonable avenue to pursue.</p><p>Krinks’ advice was to accept what services were offered, to stay in touch about living options that would allow her to keep more than one dog (of which there are none), and to open lines of dialogue with the city about where someone like her could go if not Old Tent City.</p><p>“When I was home [in West Virginia], this,” Mama V says, gesturing around her RV, motioning to the stacked dog kennels, blankets, bags,</p><p>“This,” she points to the tarps and tires around her lot,</p><p>“This is home. I wish they'd just leave us alone, let us have part of this land.”</p><p>To suburban eyes like mine, who grew up in a million-dollar home in the wealthiest county in America before the Great Recession, it’s not exactly <em>Town &amp; Country</em>.</p><p>Mama V is trying to tell me that this is how she’s going to live, wherever she’s going to live. Hers is not a sobriety or mental health problem. It’s a real estate problem.</p><p>Our conversation was interrupted by a man walking the muddy steps up to her caravan.</p><p>“Someone dead on the tracks.”</p><p>The man had come to report.</p><p>“What?!” Mama V shouts. “When? Has anyone called the cops?”</p><p>“Was he hit by a train?” I ask.</p><p>“Wanna walk down there?” Ron suggests.</p><p>Ron — who had once been convicted and imprisoned as what the DEA classified as a “Drug Kingpin” — despite that, the 60-something TSU running-back is now giving off-duty sheriff vibes, and he’s just been called back on patrol.</p><p>“I’m not sure,” is the answer to how he died.</p><p>It’s never clear if the man was hit by <em>The Music City Star</em> — Nashville’s lone, mysterious relic of a community train that bisects the camp — or if he overdosed and stumbled onto the tracks.</p><p>My later search for police records — neither a call for service or an incident report — came up empty.</p><p>It’s equally likely, residents think, that he was hit by the train as that he overdosed. Neither seem surprising. This event is newsworthy in the camp, but not <em>breaking</em> news.</p><p>It doesn’t seem like he (it’s assumed it’s a he) was a known quantity. He doesn’t have, what Miles describes as vital to have here: <strong>"notoriety."</strong></p><p>No one knows him, or thinks they know him, so people hustle back and forth along the camp trail, crisscrossing its muddy puddles — moving faster if alone, ambling slower if in a group — but always with somewhere to be.</p><p>It is decided that should go and see the man who died on the tracks.</p><p>We take our leave from Mama V, and I wonder what kind of emotional reaction I’ll have from this.</p><p>I’m thinking about how to be intentional in discussing it with my partner at home later. She won’t like if I bury the lede about voluntarily seeing a dead body today.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>How Long Until There Is a New Tent City?</strong></h1><p>A few days before this visit to Old Tent City, I got on the phone with Metro Council Member Courtney Johnston — Nashville’s conservative firebrand and one of the most vocal defenders of the Office of Homeless Services (OHS) and its Director, April Calvin.</p><p>Johnston’s views on homelessness aren’t born of theory. They got shaped a few years back when she helped oversee the closure of an encampment in her district.</p><p>She’s the first to say that just moving people into temporary motels like the Roadway Inn isn’t going to fix the underlying failures. But she understands that having a stable home is a prerequisite to getting your shit together.</p><p>She really does seem to believe in the framework, first adopted by the federal government under the George W. Bush administration, called <strong>"Housing First." </strong>The idea is that housing should not be a <em>reward</em> or <em>outcome</em> of becoming sober, obtaining mental health treatment, or any other barriers.</p><p>It should be the <strong>foundation</strong> on which your new life is built.</p><p>Supported by reams of academic reviews and promoted for years by conservatives as a “fiscally responsible” approach to reducing the public’s burden from the chronically unhoused, when executed correctly, Housing First has been demonstrated to have a success rate of <strong>88%</strong> or higher at keeping people in homes for over a year. (<em>Treatment First</em> models perform about half that well.)</p><p>Sources:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://endhomelessness.org/resources/toolkits-and-training-materials/housing-first/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Housing First - National Alliance to End Homelessness</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.51.4.487">Psychiatry Online - Housing First Review<br></a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Housing First ≠ Housing Only</strong></h3><p>Johnston is quick to explain that “Housing First” isn’t “housing only.”</p><p><em>"I think one of the things that people misunderstand — and it's not their fault, because it's called ‘Housing First’ — but it's really housing <strong>and wraparound services</strong> at the same time."</em></p><p>When it comes to Nashville’s ability to successfully implement Housing First with fidelity, Johnston doesn’t mince words:</p><p><em>"We don't have the depth of service that we need from a wraparound service perspective. We just don't."</em></p><p>Even the money that was supposed to fix that — $9 million set aside in 2022 for Housing First support services — is mostly just sitting there, she tells me.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH): Where Things Break Down</strong></h3><p>Permanent Supportive Housing, the intended landing place for Housing First programs, is even worse off.</p><p>On the topic of <strong>Strobel House</strong> — the 90-some-odd unit PSH facility she championed — Johnston says:</p><p><em>"I think they're at full occupancy at this point. If they're not, they're super freaking close."</em></p><p>She doesn’t hide her contempt for how the city’s permanent supportive housing plans have unfolded:</p><p><em>"$25 million went to gap financing for permanent supportive housing. And it was total bullshit. And I told them it was total bullshit."</em></p><p>That $25 million of ARPA funds — federal rescue money meant for permanent supportive housing — ended up producing a grand total of <strong>64 new units</strong>.</p><p>Roughly <strong>$273,000 per unit</strong> once you factor in Metro Development’s <strong>$830,000 in administrative fees</strong>.</p><p>Another 38 units went to people earning less than 30% of the area median income.</p><p>The rest?</p><p><em>"Affordable housing,"</em> — which, in practice, rarely feels affordable to people like the residents of OTC, or most Nashvillians for that matter.</p><p>Meanwhile, more than <strong>3,000 households</strong> in Nashville are still without homes.</p><p>In the past four years, Metro’s investment has only built <strong>one permanent housing unit for every thirty households who need one</strong>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

when we meet Miles.</p><p>Without othering us, he observes he’s never seen us here before.</p><blockquote><p>“That’s my nephew,” the coffee-dark Ron tells Miles, pointing back to me, the pale ancestor of a Jamestown colonizer.</p><p>“You don’t see the resemblance?” I ask Miles, our old schtick coming effortlessly.</p></blockquote><p>Miles is curious about why we’re there and happy to give us his backstory — but he doesn’t overshare.<br> He reminds me of the tour guides my family would hire to take us around Tuscany; he shares just enough of his life to help us appreciate the differentness of this place.</p><p>We walk a few hundred feet beyond a gate that marks one of Old Tent City’s amorphous boundaries, running along the gravel path of the train tracks.<br> The day’s last train has passed, and it seems that despite the parallels, we won’t have a run-in with a locomotive à la <em>Stand By Me</em>.</p><p>Ron reveals he was once a waiter on this train, back when it was the Broadway Dinner Train.<br> It’s hard to process that he’s describing the early 1990s and not the 1940s.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/06/nx-s1-5332142/doge-hud-affordable-housing-funding-air-conditioning-seniors">Related story: HUD's future remains uncertain</a>)</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>"What Are You Going to Do?"</strong></h1><blockquote><p>“What are you gonna do?” I ask Miles, referring to the camp’s impending closure.</p></blockquote><p>Our side quest to see the dead body comes to an end.</p><p>A few hundred yards down the track sits some agency’s mini-emergency services vehicle, and four or five figures in windbreakers are clustered in the classic civil servant formation — very actively standing around doing nothing, intentfully.</p><p>On closer inspection, they’re looking toward us.</p><p>They’re waving us off, telling us to go back, motioning in exaggerated arm gestures like they’re shooing birds off a runway.<br><br></p><p>We do as they gesture and head back to the camp.</p><blockquote><p>“I mean, to be honest,” Miles tells me, “if you haven't noticed, I kind of like my life. It's kind of like an RPG.”</p></blockquote><p>He drops the RPG (role-playing game) reference with an intense, esoteric meaning behind his eyes.<br> It feels like a dare or a test of some kind — <em>are you really seeing me?</em></p><p>It’s a brief moment of disjunction in our conversation, and I wonder if I’m going to get an intuition to be careful around Miles — someone this intelligent and able-bodied in an encampment like this — the potential of him being unstable and dangerous is non-zero.<br> But my intuition clocks his mysterious statement as a bit of mysticism, hard-earned after a streak of bad luck and substance predispositions.</p><p>He doesn’t seem high.<br> But he probably was recently.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>How Miles Sees the System</strong></h1><p>Miles feels looped in about how the homelessness system operates in situations like these, and he isn’t worried.</p><blockquote><p>“They're offering housing because all this systematic thing is about to shut down.”</p></blockquote><p>Old Tent City is the <strong>systemic thing</strong> in his mind.</p><blockquote><p>“So they're trying to get everybody in the housing before that happen. That's the exact same thing they did at the TA camp, which was a success, actually.”</p></blockquote><p><em>(I make a mental note to check the stats for the prior camp closure behind the TA Truck Stop, a few blocks from Nissan Stadium.)</em></p><p>Miles’ framing is interesting.<br> He’s pulling apart two actions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>They</strong> are taking apart something that has developed structure and informal rules (even if extremely risky — see: dead body on the tracks).<br><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Because</strong> they are doing this, they are offering housing before it falls apart.<br><br></p></li></ul><p>He’s the least cynical about the homelessness system of anyone we talked to — but even he sees it:</p><p>The housing isn’t coming out of pure benevolence.<br> It’s because shutting down something that has taken on a life of its own — a people's system — is harder without offering something.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Unstoppable Forces, Immovable Objects</strong></h1><p>Living outdoors, without proper shelter and without rights to the ground you sleep on, is — as I saw firsthand — pretty dangerous.</p><p>But I think it’s disingenuous to pretend we have a plethora of long-term alternatives for people living like this.</p><p>As the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250316231038/https://www.usich.gov/guidance-reports-data/federal-guidance-resources/19-strategies-communities-address-encampments"> U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH)</a> put it in their 2024 document, <em>19 Strategies for Communities to Address Encampments Humanely and Effectively</em>:</p><p><strong>Many members of the public worry about the health, safety, and economic impact of encampments and want swift action.<br><br></strong>But the reality is that affordable housing is often unavailable, and lasting solutions take time. Furthermore, many shelters are full, only offer short stays, or do not accommodate people with disabilities and/or older adults.</p><p>Some shelters require sobriety or have other programmatic requirements that make them difficult to access for people struggling with mental health or substance use disorders.</p><p>Some people feel safer and more connected to others in encampments than in shelters. The reality is that some people give up on the shelter system both because of barriers and because it offers no clear path to permanent housing.</p><p>This leaves thousands of people with nowhere else to go but the street, where they face the deadly risks of hunger, disease, extreme weather, and violence.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>The Ultimate Goal, According to USICH</strong></h1><blockquote><p><strong>"The ultimate goal,"</strong> USICH wrote in April 2024,<br> <strong>"should be to move people into permanent housing and free up public spaces without the threat of forcing people to leave an encampment."</strong></p></blockquote><p>But here's the problem:</p><ul><li><p>We <strong>don't</strong> have anywhere near the volume of permanent housing units needed.<br><br></p></li><li><p>We <strong>don't</strong> have enough wraparound services for the limited transitional spaces that exist.<br><br></p></li><li><p>And transitional placements — without services — often fail.<br><br></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Three Bad Options</strong></h1><p>You can:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Move people into transitional spaces</strong> without services → <em>Bad idea.<br><br></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Force people out</strong> without permanent housing lined up → <em>Bad idea.<br><br></em></p></li><li><p><strong>Leave people outdoors</strong> indefinitely → <em>Also a bad idea.<br><br></em></p></li></ul><p>Navigating these Catch-22s — looking for the least-worst option — is why national partners and federal guidance used to matter so much.</p><p>When I worked in the Mayor’s Office of Community Safety, collaborations with national technical assistance providers were a godsend whenever unstoppable forces collided with immovable objects.</p><p>But today, that support is evaporating.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>What Project 2025 Wants: Ending Housing First</strong></h1><p>In the conservative<a href="https://www.project2025.org/"> Project 2025 playbook</a>, which lays out the roadmap for a future conservative administration, Housing First isn’t seen as a strategy worth saving. It’s seen as part of the problem.</p><p>Project 2025 argues that:</p><ul><li><p>Housing First is a "far-left idea" that mistakenly treats homelessness as primarily circumstantial rather than behavioral.<br><br></p></li><li><p>It claims Housing First "fails to acknowledge" that resolving homelessness usually requires resolving <strong>mental health</strong> and <strong>substance abuse</strong> issues first.<br><br></p></li><li><p>It proposes <strong>ending</strong> Housing First policies altogether in HUD grants — including forcing Continuums of Care (like Nashville’s) to stop prioritizing housing without preconditions.<br><br></p></li></ul><p>Instead of permanent supportive housing, Project 2025 pushes for a return to <strong>transitional housing</strong> models that <strong>require</strong> mental health and substance use treatment first — before permanent placement is even considered.</p><blockquote><p><em>"HUD should implement administrative changes and seek statutory authority to end all Housing First directives of Continuum of Care (CoC) grantees and contract homelessness providers."<br></em> —<a href="https://www.project2025.org/"> Project 2025, HUD Chapter</a></p></blockquote><p>This is a massive philosophical shift:<br> Where Housing First says <em>housing is the first step to stability,<br></em> Project 2025 says <em>treatment and recovery must come first — or housing won't happen at all.</em></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>And One More Thing: The USICH Is... Gone</strong></h1><p>Unfortunately, the agency that wrote the best practices I’ve been quoting — the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness — <strong>no longer exists.</strong></p><p>Its closure left a vacuum in national standards and best practices at exactly the moment that local governments most needed a sane referee.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link

camp at its most western point, a higher elevation than the rest, about 70 feet from the Cumberland River — close enough that a misplaced sleeping bag could roll, hop, and bounce into it. I know this area from a past visit. Miles confirms my read of the sociology: this area is run by “Trish.”</p><p>This plot, the most similar in appearance to a traditional camping flat, has a metropolitan feel compared to the wooded half-clearings of other sites. There’s a clear demarcation of outside and inside — an inner sanctum where those with some status keep themselves, while part-timers claim space outside the gates.</p><p>Inside, behind double rows of commandeered NDOT steel barricades standing on their sides, tiny Trish with a face tattoo has strict rules, and entrance through the barricades has to be granted. She’s not in right now, but Miles agrees that Trish runs the most organized version of community at Old Tent City.</p><p>It’s much more <em>The Last of Us</em> or <em>The Walking Dead</em> than <em>Leave No Trace.</em> There’s a crust-punk ethos here — more evidence of experiments with propane and propane accessories than in other parts of the camp — and a higher concentration of vape smokers compared to traditional cigarette smokers.</p><p>We walk with Miles eastward on the muddy road, heading back the way we came.</p><p>"You're looking at a campground," Miles says. "But, you know, to the naked eye, this looks like a bunch of disarray and chaos. I mean, it's organized. You know what belongs. I can tell you this is Mama V’s area, and all Mama V’s associates."</p><p>"Associates" is a funny word here. It’s partly a Southernism. It also feels like the best way to describe the extended "chosen family" networks — the ones that, if you called them “chosen families” in the LGBTQ+ sense, might earn you a scoff. Not necessarily because of prejudice, but because that type of term reclamation already feels like a forfeit to them. I can easily imagine Mama V saying, <em>"Chosen family? Fuck that. This is just my family-family."</em></p><p>I ask Miles what Mama V’s vibe is. After all, she was my original introduction to OTC through Open Table Nashville, but I don’t want to make the anthropologist’s rookie mistake of assuming the first person you meet is the representative sample.</p><p>"Me and her have never conversated," he tells me. "To be honest, the only time me and her have ever conversated was one of her associates got really mad at me for picking up sticks around there. That’s why I’m never around there."<br> I wonder if there’s more complicated history there.</p><p>The camp is starting to take shape more vividly in my mind’s eye. At first, all you can see is omnipresent trash and debris. But soon, you can discern chaos from intentionality. You can't look in any direction without seeing volumes of unwanted detritus — the unwanted byproducts of late capitalism — but it's increasingly obvious when things are <em>left</em> and when things are <em>put.</em></p><p>I think back to Aristotle’s distinction between a <strong>pile</strong> and a <strong>heap</strong>. A pile is random. A heap has purpose.</p><p>There are decisions being made here. Sometimes a bag is stuck in a tree by accident, but sometimes it's placed there intentionally for privacy, or to mark a boundary. Many of the decisions, my eyes begin to see, are about safety.</p><p>Spray-painted on tilted plywood, lashed menacingly to the side of a large polygonal structure off the mud road, the words stand out clearly:</p><p><strong>"ANNOUNCE BEFORE ENTERING."</strong></p><p>It has the aesthetic of a Detroit-themed haunted house, but the functionality of a gated community.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>“Open Table is in open warfare with April [Calvin]/OHS”</strong></h3><p>That’s how a high-ranking Metro official described the situation to me when I expressed some optimism that maybe things in the homelessness response world could improve.</p><p>Council Member Courtney Johnston has a simple framework for understanding the tension. In her view, every service provider working in this space should have the goal of solving themselves out of a job. And a lot of them don’t. Instead, she argues, some organizations depend on outdoor living continuing because that’s where they do their work. It’s how they justify donations: by helping people out there. If you close all the camps, Johnston says, there's no need for some of these organizations anymore — unless they're willing to pivot to new work. Which, she adds flatly, “they won’t.”</p><p>“That feels a little cynical,” I push back. “It’s not like people are exactly getting rich off this.”</p><p>She concedes that nobody’s personally cashing in — but insists the organizations still are. She doesn’t say Open Table Nashville by name. I don’t either. But I think it’s who we’re both thinking of.</p><p>For what it’s worth, Open Table Nashville’s last publicly available tax return shows a net income of negative fourteen grand. So maybe that’s not who she means.</p><p>Still, her certainty here feels different from the sharpness she shows when talking about Housing First or broken real estate deals. Less learned from direct experience. More like something that <em>needs</em> to be true for the rest of her worldview to hold together. It’s more paradigmatic, less lived.</p><p>Council Member Johnston seems to operate at a curious junction of value systems. Serving the homeless is, very much, a team sport in her mind. And on her team, she expects results. Points on the board. Excuses are for losers. But she also thinks the other team — the Open Tables of the world — aren’t even playing the same game. They should be kicked out of the league entirely.</p><p>When I put the accusations directly to Rev. Lindsey Krinks of Open Table Nashville — that they are exploiting the unhoused, that they are prolonging encampments — I get a long, exhausted sigh.</p><p>Open Table Nashville is independently funded, she tells me. Unlike most service providers for the unhoused, their finances aren’t tied into the big, sprawling ecosystem of homelessness grants and contracts. Which means they don’t have a built-in incentive to keep people stuck outside. They can and do, she says, support people once they’re in transitional housing too. That’s not a deal-breaker for their donors.</p><p>The idea that Open Table Nashville <em>wants</em> people to live outdoors? “Absurd,” Krinks says. And from what I’ve seen, I have to agree. In every conversation I watched her have with OTC residents, they were encouraged to apply for housing with the Office of Homeless Services. More importantly, she always asked them first: <em>“What do you want?”</em> and <em>“How are you feeling about things?”</em></p><p>It seems obvious to me that transparency, consent, and collaboration with the people whose lives you’re shaping should be the bare minimum. But somehow, in Nashville’s homelessness services world, basic requests like these are interpreted as acts of war.</p><p>It’s hard for me not to see asking for transparency, for collaboration, for basic respect — when you have tremendous power over the least powerful people in our city — as simply Christian. But for some reason, the wires seem crossed. Simple, innocuous things like a petition asking for a meeting with the mayor get recast as an insurgent threat.</p><p>The Office of Homeless Services recently became the Collaborative Applicant for Nashville’s Continuum of Care, giving it the reins over tens of millions of dollars in federal homelessness funding. Simultaneously, OHS has shrunk the size of governance bodies and consolidated control. This is classic vertical power consolidation: standardize messaging, prioritize stability over debate. In that system, criticism from the outside — even when it’s offered in good faith — doesn’t land as helpful. It lands as disorderly. Dangerous.</p><p>In a command-and-control system, feedback isn’t taken as input for improvement. It’s taken as a challenge to authority.</p><p>With so many complicated relationships between service providers, landlords, developers, nonprofit leaders, and political offices, it’s not hard to find perverse incentives anywhere you look. So I don’t think Johnston is wrong that money drives dysfunction. I just think maybe she’s following it into the wrong pockets.</p><p>There’s a perpetual background hum in the human services world that we need to “communicate and collaborate more.” But that’s easier said than done when critiques are interpreted as betrayal. When I raise this to Johnston — that some organizations are scared to speak openly because they fear retaliation — her response is blunt:</p><blockquote><p>"I think April [Calvin] is probably one of the nicest people I've come across. So to think that she would retaliate? It's unwarranted. It's unfounded. And I’ve seen some of these same organizations that are complaining actively sabotage things."</p></blockquote><p>She says she saw it happen when an encampment in her district was being closed.</p><p>Our conversation later circles back to a simple point.</p><blockquote><p>“It's just frustrating," Johnston says, "when I hear things like, 'April's in over her head' or 'April’s going to retaliate.'<br> Can we just focus on the work instead of having these goofy ass turf wars and personality issues and whatever?<br> Because while all this nitpicky and ego issues, quite frankly, you got people literally dying on the streets."</p></blockquote><p>I agree, in theory.<br> Turf wars and personality conflicts <em>should</em> be solved — if they're in the way of making things better.</p><blockquote><p>"Systems work better when there's good vibes between them," I suggest. "That's the reason to fix the turf wars. Not because we want everyone to be friends, but because people get better outcomes that way."</p><p>"Right," she agrees.<br> "No, it's because it's about the work. And it’s about the outcome."</p></blockquote><p>I like where we land, in theory.<br> But I wonder if we, as a city, even agree on what outcome we're actually aiming for.<br> And who gets to ask the question.</p><div><hr></div><p>Miles takes us to the bridge under I-24, where in the fall of last year Metro government demolished several multi-story DIY homes that had been built.</p><div

https://wpln.org/post/metro-will-demolish-homes-in-a-40-year-old-encampment-but-wont-clear-out-residents/</p><p>Mama V had already told us her take on it:</p><blockquote><p>"They came in and bulldozed all that down first and only gave them 30 days. And they had to get an extension. Well, that didn't go over well. It caused a big conflict. People cussing them, everything else.<br> Because you think about it, Will was out here since he was a teenager. And where he messed up is he tapped into the electric, he tapped into the sewer, and he tapped into the water.<br> And they came in and just bulldozed all his belongings and everything in it down.<br> He didn't even have a chance to get none of his stuff out or nothing.<br> He left here with a car and one bag of clothes."</p></blockquote><p>At the time, residents of Old Tent City released a statement — not substantially different than the one they put out last week — trying to explain their perspective.</p><p>They wrote:</p><blockquote><p>"There is always going to be a need for a place people can go until they get housing. A lot of us have pets, and there are lots of couples here. Service organizations also need centralized places to meet with people. Tent City has existed since the early 1980s. All the other big camps have been shut down, shelters are full, and it’s nearly impossible to find housing that we can afford, especially housing that will take our pets."</p></blockquote><p>The new closure deadline of June 1 gives some structure to the move — something anyone who's ever had to relocate their home can understand. But things are predictably unpredictable when you don’t have a fixed address.</p><p>The first time I visited Old Tent City, there was another type of crisis happening. Several residents, including a man named Stan, were given half an hour to leave or face arrest. Confusion abounded about which police force had even issued the order. Were they Metro police? TDOT police? A private security firm? No one knew. Did they even know that Metro was supposedly coordinating with the camp to relocate people? Unclear.</p><p>Stan retells the story to Ron while we walk.</p><p>The officers first told some men living in a neatly built shelter fenced by shipping pallets and decorated with well-kept bicycles that they had to leave because they were allegedly on TDOT property. Then they came to Stan's compound — reportedly because the owner of a billboard that looms over Stan’s structure had called in a complaint.</p><p>The officers told Stan: <em>"You gotta go too."</em></p><p>Stan's response: <em>"I ain't went nowhere. So if I'm breaking the law, put the handcuffs on me."<br></em> He didn’t get cuffed. But it didn’t exactly resolve the situation either.</p><p>It took a City Council Member who happened to be on-site that day, along with frantic phone calls between community organizers and police precinct commanders, to get the stand-off defused.</p><p>I ask Stan if he’s met with the Office of Homeless Services, who has been setting up a booth during weekdays to facilitate people's transitions into the Roadway Inn and other housing options.</p><p>He hasn’t. But he’s been through this system before.</p><blockquote><p>"My experience so far has been nothing," Stan says.<br> "They gave me seven different caseworkers. Salvation Army said they'd get my ID, get me those vouchers, get me food stamps — nothing.<br> I’d go in and they’d say, 'Your case manager quit, they’re not here anymore. Come back tomorrow. She's sick.'<br> Finally, I just gave up."</p></blockquote><p>An under-discussed weapon wielded against the poor is <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>The poor are expected to be endlessly patient.<br> To return day after day.<br> To tolerate random changes in office hours.<br> To withstand exasperation from overworked staff.<br> To accept systems built on making the infinite (poverty) fit into finite time (bureaucratic case files).</p><p>But when a resident makes a complaint — or when a "taxpayer" (a distinction that means less in a state without income tax, where the poor pay heavily through sales taxes) calls about a camp — suddenly time dilates sharply, like the edge of a black hole.</p><p>Now, there is urgency.<br> Pack up your life in 30 minutes.<br> Disappear, or be arrested.<br> No guarantee of where you’re going. No warning. No clear instructions.</p><p>And the punishment for failing to comply? Of course: doing time.</p><p>Stan experienced something Council Member Johnston spoke to me about directly: falling through the cracks between case managers.</p><p>She described it this way:</p><p>"Let’s say I become homeless and Sharon — I'm just picking a name — Sharon is my case manager. Sharon changes jobs because she gets burned out — which 100% happens, it’s a hard job. So Sharon says, 'I’m out of here.' Well, all of a sudden, what happened to Courtney? Nobody knows. And so I get entered back into the system."</p><p>She’s describing the kind of thing I honestly love exploring. The cracks between personal relationships and boring work logistics like have an up-to-date <em>database.</em></p><p>"We have to start getting some consistency and accountability from the organizations taking on case management," she adds, "so that people don’t just disappear when their case manager quits."</p><p>Stan and Johnston are circling the same diagnosis.<br><br>And Miles, without realizing it, points to the same remedy.</p><div><hr></div><p>I ask Miles about the different ways people live together at Old Tent City.<br> Some spots feel like loose clusters of individuals who just happen to be near each other.<br> Other spots feel like real communities — like mini-villages, with rules and relationships.</p><p>“What do you think makes a community?” I ask. “Some of these folks seem like they're just kind of living near each other, but some of them seem like they're <em>in</em> community.”</p><p>Miles ponders it, balancing the strange stick on his shoulder like a pet bird while we all step carefully around deeper puddles from the week of rain.</p><p>"I think one of the number one things for making a community is what do you call it — notoriety, within yourself, and in communication," he says.</p><p>"What's the notoriety piece?" I ask.</p><p>Miles smiles like it’s the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>"The notoriety piece is making sure that everybody knows you. So, like, no one questions your existence. No one questions who you are. No one questions why you're doing what you're doing, or why you're around with your house. You know what I mean?"</p><p>Something clicks.</p><p>The man found dead on the tracks — whoever he was — didn’t have notoriety.<br>Nobody recognized him.<br>Nobody could say where he lived, what his history was, who would miss him.<br>He didn't have a place in the social fabric of the camp.<br>He wasn’t protected.</p><p>At OTC, and probably in a hundred other invisible encampments like it across America, notoriety is the first step toward safety.</p><p>If people know you — if you have standing — you’re more likely to survive.</p><p>It’s also, paradoxically, the first step toward getting <em>out.</em></p><p>To move into transitional housing, to get into a voucher system, to even get a chance at permanent supportive housing — you have to be known.</p><p>You have to exist to a case manager.<br>That case manager has to exist and be valued inside a larger system.<br> Snd that system has to still have somewhere for you to go.</p><p>When there aren’t enough units, or enough services, or enough consistent staff, notoriety becomes the only real currency.<br><br>You make yourself visible.<br>You flag yourself.<br>You hope someone notices before it’s too late.</p><p>The petitions the residents sign, the protests community orgs facilitate — they’re all ways of gaining notoriety. Of waving your arms at the coming train.<br><br></p><p>Refusing to be another anonymous corpse on the railroad tracks.</p>
