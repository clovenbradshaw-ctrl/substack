Grounded in the story of one man’s journey in and out of shelter, it explores how political and cultural shifts are reframing homelessness once again as a moral failing rather than a structural one — but with cruelty being codified into oublic policy. As support systems are dismantled and punitive models return, we examine what this change reveals about America's beliefs around worth, help, and who deserves a place to live.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong><a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/161638971/act-the-ladder-and-the-hammer">Act 1: The Ladder and the Hammer</a></strong></h3><p>A fragile experiment in compassion gives Curtis — and America — a glimpse of what housing without conditions can do. But as politics shift and funding vanishes, the moral foundation of Housing First is quietly pulled away, revealing a deeper cultural discomfort with help that asks for nothing in return.</p><h3><strong><a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/161638971/act-the-hammer-descends">Act 2: The Hammer Descends</a></strong></h3><p>Enter Robert Marbut and the ideology of earned help: sobriety, obedience, and suffering as prerequisites for shelter. With the rise of Project 2025 and the velvet hammer, compassion is reframed as permissiveness, and Housing First is dismantled not because it failed — but because it succeeded in the wrong moral language.</p><h3><strong><a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/161638971/act-climbing-back-up">Act 3: Climbing Back Up</a></strong></h3><p>Faith-based programs take center stage, offering both aid and judgment. But within that model, a quiet theology emerges: that grace must precede transformation. The seeds of a new synthesis are planted — one that reimagines stability and support not as opposites, but as partners.</p><h3><strong><a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/161638971/coda-after-the-fall">Coda: After the Fall</a></strong></h3><p>As federal support collapses and ideological purges hollow out the safety net, the true cost becomes clear: invisible suffering, institutional erosion, and moral retreat. Yet in the rubble, a new ethic begins to stir — shaped by memory, by clarity, and by the conviction that next time, the ladder must be built to last.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Act 1: The Ladder and the Hammer</strong></h1><p>To tell the story of how America shifted from a war on homelessness, to waging war on the homeless, let’s jump forward. Not a generation from now, or even a presidential term. Let’s flash forward just a few months.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h5>Tuesday, September 23, 2025<br>Portland, Oregon</h5><p>It’s early morning. The traffic on I-4O5 is already snarling. Tires over wet asphalt. A distant truck horn blows.</p><p>And in the space between those sounds, you can hear something out of place: the crinkle of an unfolding plastic tarp being fastened to the metal frame of a tent. The puttering of a person hiding a few stray objects away before bed.</p><p>That tent belongs to a man named Curtis. Those objects are his only worldly possessions.</p><p>Curtis lived for over six years on a patch of brambles behind a freeway retaining wall, wedged between the road and a chain-link fence. He had a bum knee from a hit-and-run a decade ago. He had a dog named Freckles who wouldn’t let anyone but Curtis near her.</p><p>Also – Curtis had schizophrenia.</p><p>Curtis had bounced between shelters, jail cells, and the emergency room. Never for long. Always back to the same curb.</p><p>Then, in 2018, something changed. A city-run Housing First pilot gave Curtis an apartment. Not a cot in a group shelter. An <em>apartment</em>.</p><p>One bedroom. Heat. A place where Freckles could sleep inside, curled on the foot of his bed.</p><p>There was no requirement that he be sober. No rule that he attend therapy or medication management. Just: <em>here’s a home</em>. A social worker would stop by. Support was offered on site every day from a variety of organizations. But nothing was required.</p><p>During his time on the street, he’d been offered many blessings – and tried many things to stay sober and employed. But with the constant stress of knowing that a single slip up could cost him everything, with such little grace attached to the grace he was given – it’d never stuck before.</p><p>Curtis never thought of himself as much of a people person, but that was partly because of what he’d experienced in life. There wasn’t much of what you’d call “unconditional love” in his home growing up. And much of the support he’d gotten since being on the street had a lot of strings attached. Even the religious groups that preached God’s unconditional love – for some reason their help often seemed to be the most conditional. Once he had been two months into a “work therapy” program where, in exchange for room and board, he was required to work forty hours a week without pay. But after relapsing once, on what happened to be the anniversary of the death of his brother, he was kicked out of the program.</p><p>Events like that led Curtis to think less of himself. And it made him think even less of this “all-loving God” whose name was invoked each time he was turned back out on the street for not “wanting salvation enough”.</p><p>But with Housing First, things were different. Curtis showered each day. He started cooking again. Before, he sometimes remembered his meds. Now, sometimes he forgot them. He even let a case manager help him apply for disability. Freckles got a new collar.</p><p>He wasn’t “fixed.” But he was housed. And for the first time in years, he wasn’t surviving. He was living.</p><p>That program was quietly funded by a mix of federal and local dollars. And it worked. Until 2025, when the funding dried up without warning — part of a broader freeze ordered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p>The building Curtis lived in was sold off within months. He was given thirty days. The eviction notice was slid under his door. Because of a misunderstanding between the non-profit and the local sheriffs department, he was actually forced to be out on the street after only 24 days.</p><p>That’s where we found him again. Back on the same patch of earth. Freckles curled beside him. Same tarp, same freeway hum.</p><p>Curtis wasn’t part of some social experiment gone wrong. The experiment worked.</p><p>But the country changed.</p><p></p><p></p><h4>This is about that change.</h4><p>It’s about how America built a fragile ladder — out of housing, policy, and empirical data — and then, just as people were beginning to climb it, swung a hammer at its rungs.</p><p>That ladder had a name: <strong>Housing First</strong>.</p><p>And the hammer? It came in the shape of a very old idea, wrapped in new political language: that people need to earn help. That housing should come after repentance. That suffering is a kind of social test — and only those who pass it deserve a room, a key, a door that locks.</p><p>The deeper story here isn’t just about public policy. It’s about worldview.</p><p>Because Housing First didn’t just give people homes — it challenged America’s moral software.</p><p>And that made it dangerous.</p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><h4>To understand what Housing First really is, you have to understand what came before it.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>For decades, homelessness in the U.S. was treated not as a housing problem, but a behavior problem. In the popular imagination, if you were on the street, you’d done something wrong. Drugs, mental illness, laziness — whatever the diagnosis, the prescription was usually the same: <em>get your act together first</em>.</p><p>This became known in policy circles as the “treatment first” model. A kind of moral staircase. Get sober, take your meds, follow the rules — <em>then</em> you might qualify for transitional housing. Prove you’re ready. Earn it.</p><p>And for many people, that staircase just led in a circle. You had to be healthy to get housing — but you needed housing to get healthy.</p><p>Then, in the early 2000s, something shifted.</p><p>A handful of social workers, psychologists, and data analysts — people like Sam Tsemberis at Pathways to Housing — started running the numbers. And they found something that didn’t make sense. The costliest homeless individuals — the ones who cycled in and out of jails and hospitals — weren’t being helped by the old model. They were bleeding the system dry <em>and</em> staying homeless.</p><p>So they tried something radical: <strong>give them housing first</strong>. No strings. Just stability. Then offer voluntary support — therapy, medication management, job training. But no hoops. No punishment.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>Housing retention rates soared. ER visits dropped. Police encounters fell. Even substance use declined for some clients, just by virtue of being housed. One New York City study showed that giving housing to chronically homeless individuals saved over <strong>$16,000 per person per year</strong> in public costs.</p><p>Cities like Salt Lake City adopted the model at scale — and cut chronic homelessness by over 90%.</p><div><hr></div><h4>But maybe the most surprising part?</h4><p></p><p>It didn’t start on the left.</p><p>Housing First was embraced by the <strong>George W. Bush administration</strong> — specifically by Philip Mangano, the homelessness czar at the time, who championed it as a fiscally conservative, results-driven approach. It was efficient. Humane. Scalable.</p><p>It survived through Obama. Expanded under Biden. Became the backbone of federal homelessness policy.</p><p>For a brief, unlikely moment, Housing First was the closest thing America had to a consensus.</p><p>But beneath that consensus was an unresolved tension.</p><p>Because Housing First wasn’t just a program. It was a challenge to something deeper: <strong>the belief that people must become morally deserving before they can be given help</strong>.</p><p>It told a different story. That people are deserving <em>because they are human</em>. That stability is a precondition for recovery, not a reward for it. That society bears some responsibility for the circumstances in which people fall — and therefore for giving them a floor to stand on.</p><p>That story — that worldview — was tolerated for a while. Quietly. Because the data was good. Because the headlines were optimistic.</p><p>But as homelessness surged in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco — not because Housing First failed, but because rents exploded and the housing stock didn’t grow — a new story crept back in.</p><p>One we’d never really gotten rid of.</p><p>That people were choosing this.<br> That addiction was the root, not the result.<br> That chaos on the streets was proof that compassion had gone too far.</p><p>And with that narrative came a new energy. Political. Religious. Punitive.</p><p>A hammer, held by familiar hands.</p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><h4>In 2025, the hammer is in full swing.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>A conservative policy blueprint called Project 2025 urged an end to all Housing First programs. HUD froze billions in approved grants. Faith-based shelters — long skeptical of “low-barrier” models — were elevated, funded, empowered.</p><p>And the message changed.</p><p>No more unconditional housing. No more tolerance for relapse. Help was to be earned again.</p><p>Housing First — once bipartisan, quietly effective — became a punching bag. A culture war symbol. Proof, in some corners, that liberal compassion had failed.</p><p>And so people like Curtis lost their homes. Not because the program failed him. But because the political narrative required that he be seen as unworthy.</p><p>The ladder held.<br> But the hammer swung anyway.</p><div><hr></div><h4>What we’re seeing now is more than a policy reversal.</h4><p></p><p>It’s a reckoning with two very different ideas about what homelessness is.</p><p>Is it the result of systems failing people? Or people failing themselves?</p><p>Is it a health crisis? Or a moral one?</p><p>And what happens when the story we tell about homelessness shifts from tragedy… to blame?</p><p>In the next act, we’ll meet the man who took that story and gave it policy teeth. Robert Marbut. The architect of the backlash. The voice behind “Housing Fourth.”</p><p>We’ll follow the rise of Project 2025. The push to criminalize street life. And the reemergence of an old American theology — the one that says <strong>help must be earned</strong>, and that suffering might just be necessary.</p><p>Because before the hammer came down, someone had to pick it up.</p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Act 2: The Hammer Descends</strong></h1><p></p><p>You may not know Robert Marbut’s name. But if you want to understand how the U.S. government went from <em>housing-first</em> to <em>housing last, maybe,</em> you need to understand the man who believed America had made a profound mistake — and that he alone knew how to fix it.</p><p>Marbut wasn’t your standard Beltway appointee. He came out of Texas, with the bearing of a football coach and the certainty of a revivalist. He liked direct orders. Clear rules. Hard truths.</p><p>In the 2000s, he’d been involved in running shelters and advising cities on homelessness policy. And everywhere he went, he told the same story: <strong>Housing First was enabling dysfunction.</strong></p><p>In his eyes, it let people opt out of getting better. Worse — it rewarded bad behavior. Drug use, refusal to comply, emotional volatility — all of it, to him, was being subsidized in the name of compassion.</p><p>He had a different idea.</p><p>He called it <em>Housing Fourth</em>.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><h4>Let’s pause on that phrase. Not Housing Second. <em>Fourth.</em></h4><p></p><p></p><p>Because before someone gets housing, Marbut believed they should do at least three things:</p><ol><li><p>Get sober.</p></li><li><p>Address their mental health.</p></li><li><p>Show commitment to self-sufficiency.</p></li></ol><p>Then — and only then — comes the apartment. The lock. The key.</p><p>He didn’t hide the severity of his approach. In fact, he gave it a name.</p><p>He called it the <strong>velvet hammer.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h4>It’s soft, at first. Then, quickly, bludgeoning.</h4><p>The hammer part was clear enough: strict rules, mandatory programs, zero-tolerance drug policies, enforced curfews, behavioral contracts, even GPS tracking in some programs.</p><p>But the velvet? That was the PR. The promise that it wasn’t cruelty — it was <em>discipline with compassion</em>. Tough love. Guardrails. The illusion of softness over the mechanism of control.</p><p>Marbut pitched the velvet hammer as the only way to break through what he called <strong>“learned helplessness.”</strong> In his view, homelessness was not primarily about the housing market, trauma, or untreated illness — it was about bad habits. About what he called, and I quote, <strong>“dysfunctional, entitlement-based behavior.”</strong></p><p>He didn’t want to criminalize homelessness outright. But he wanted cities to <strong>make it uncomfortable</strong> to remain homeless. Don’t feed people in parks. Don’t let them loiter near libraries. Move services out of city centers. If people refused treatment, withhold shelter.</p><p>In Marbut’s world, help was always conditional.</p><p>Because if you didn’t attach a consequence to failure — he argued — you were just enabling it.</p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><h4>In 2019, President Trump appointed Marbut to head the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. </h4><p></p><p></p><p>That’s the body that coordinates federal homelessness policy — think of it as the conductor for 19 different agencies, from HUD to Health and Human Services.</p><p>By then, the war over Housing First had already begun.</p><p>A few months earlier, Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers had issued a 40-page report criticizing Housing First. It used phrases like “permissive” and “misguided.” It accused cities like San Francisco of fueling homelessness by making it too easy to remain unhoused. And it framed Housing First not as an incomplete strategy — but as a dangerous one.</p><p>Then came Marbut.</p><p>And with him, the hammer.</p><div><hr></div><h4>There’s something you should understand about how these reversals happened. </h4><p></p><p>They weren’t announced on podiums with blaring sirens. They came quietly. Technocratically.</p><p><strong>Budgets were frozen. Guidance letters rewritten. Enforcement mechanisms shelved.</strong></p><p>In early 2025, over $3.6 billion in federal homelessness grants — already approved by Congress — were suddenly paused. No explanation. Programs scrambled. Cities like Seattle, Chicago, and Austin delayed key services. Outreach workers were furloughed. Contracts canceled.</p><p>The hammer wasn’t always a law. Sometimes, it was the <em>absence</em> of funding.</p><p>Sometimes it was a shrug in the form of a memo.</p><p>But the philosophy was unmistakable.</p><p>Under Marbut, and later his successors in a second Trump term, the administration made it clear: <strong>the federal government would no longer enforce Housing First compliance</strong>. If a local provider wanted to mandate sobriety before shelter? Fine. If they kicked out someone for relapsing? Also fine.</p><p>The velvet hammer was now official policy.</p><p></p><p></p><div><hr></div><h4>This shift wasn’t just bureaucratic. It was cultural.</h4><p></p><p>Suddenly, the story of homelessness had a new villain: <em>compassion gone too far.</em></p><p>Fox News ran segments showing tent encampments and drug use, asking: “Is Housing First making the problem worse?” Op-eds declared that “giving someone a house before they’ve cleaned up is like rewarding failure.” In one viral interview, a conservative commentator asked, <strong>“Why should the taxpayer give a free apartment to someone who won’t even try to help themselves?”</strong></p><p>And the answer, in this new worldview, was: <strong>they shouldn’t.</strong></p><div><hr></div><h4>Let’s be clear: this wasn’t about cost-cutting. </h4><p></p><p>If anything, the velvet hammer was expensive. Mandatory treatment programs. Increased policing. Fines, incarceration. All of it added up.</p><p>But the point wasn’t efficiency.</p><p>It was <strong>restoring a moral order</strong>.</p><p>One where housing is not a right, but a reward.</p><p>Where dignity must be earned, not assumed.</p><p>Where suffering is not a failure of the system — but a test of character.</p><p>And the hammer? It was just how you <em>reminded people of the rules</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h4>Here’s the thing, though. The hammer doesn’t just fall on the homeless.</h4><p></p><p>It falls on the people who serve them. Social workers told to choose between funding and their ethics. Shelter managers pressured to add curfews, to evict clients for relapsing. Nonprofits defunded if they refused to comply.</p><p>It falls on case managers like the one who worked with Curtis — who watched a year of fragile progress collapse in a week when the grant that paid for his apartment vanished.</p><p>The hammer falls on everyone downstream from a moral decision made upstream.</p><p>That decision was this: <strong>help without strings is not help at all</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h4>In the next act, we’ll examine where that decision comes from.</h4><p></p><p>Because the hammer didn’t fall from the sky. It was forged — over decades — in a crucible of conservative theology, middle-class morality, and institutional religion.</p><p>We’ll look at how faith-based organizations like the Salvation Army became both allies and symbols in this shift. How personal transformation became the currency of housing. And how the velvet hammer isn’t just a policy tool — it’s a worldview.</p><p>The idea that to house someone, you must first <em>redeem</em> them.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Act 3: Climbing Back Up</strong></h1><p>In 1865, a man named William Booth walked the slums of East London, preaching to anyone who would listen — or couldn’t get away fast enough. Booth wasn’t looking for respectability. He was looking for the poor. The broken. The drunk. The damned.</p><p>He brought with him a Bible, a ladle of soup, and a simple theology: no one gets saved while their stomach is empty and their feet are cold.</p><p>That, in its earliest form, was the <strong>Salvation Army</strong> — a bootstrapped fusion of Christian mission and social aid. Preach the gospel. Serve the poor. Don’t separate the two.</p><p>Their motto, famously, was <strong>“Soup, Soap, and Salvation.”</strong></p><p>In many ways, the Salvation Army laid the groundwork for America’s <strong>faith-based response to homelessness</strong>. </p><p>Today, they operate shelters, transitional housing, rehab centers. In some cities, they’re the largest provider of beds for the unhoused. They’re a fixture — and a contradiction.</p><p>Because while the Salvation Army does life-saving work, it also embodies a tension that sits at the very heart of this debate:<br> <strong>Is housing an act of mercy… or a step on the path to moral redemption?</strong></p><p>In 2025, this tension isn’t theoretical. It’s policy.</p><p>Under Project 2025 and the Trump administration’s restructured homelessness framework, <strong>faith-based organizations</strong> like the Salvation Army have been elevated. Not just as service providers — but as moral exemplars. A kind of ideological counterweight to the secular Housing First model.</p><p>In congressional hearings, HUD Secretary Scott Turner praised these organizations for “addressing the whole person” — meaning not just food and shelter, but soul and discipline.</p><p>And in practice? That means rules. Curfews. Mandatory chapel. Clean-and-sober housing only. Clients sometimes breathalyzed nightly. Some shelters that turn away transgender individuals, citing religious belief. Others that require attendance in Bible study or structured work therapy.</p><p>The logic is simple: homelessness is a symptom of spiritual drift. The solution is structured redemption.</p><p>And here’s the thing: <strong>it works.</strong></p><p>Sometimes.</p><p>For some people.</p><p>There are people who credit the Salvation Army with saving their lives. Who say that structure was what they needed. That surrendering to a higher power — in a chapel basement or in a 12-step meeting — was the first rung back up the ladder.</p><p>The velvet hammer, they’ll tell you, had a purpose.</p><p>But that’s not everyone. And it is just that kind of difficulty with nuance, a fixation on either/or framings of humans, that even those in the Salvation Army know is hold back their potential to do God’s work on earth.</p><p></p><div><hr></div><h4>A few years ago, an Australian theologian named Jason Davies-Kildea wrote a thesis. </h4><p></p><p>He had worked for over 18 years with the Salvation Army, and he wanted to understand what “salvation” really meant in the modern Army.</p><p>Was it just getting someone to a pew? Or was helping someone find housing also part of saving them?</p><p>His answer was quiet. But radical.</p><p>He argued that <strong>housing someone — even without preaching to them — is itself an act of salvation</strong>. That when Jesus said to clothe the naked, feed the hungry, and house the homeless, he didn’t attach conditions.</p><p>Davies-Kildea wasn’t rejecting the Salvation Army’s mission. He was expanding it. Saying, in effect: <em>Grace comes first. Then maybe change. But grace must come first.</em></p><p>This idea — that <em>help doesn’t require proof of worth</em> — sounds suspiciously like Housing First.</p><div><hr></div><h4>And maybe that’s the hidden synthesis.</h4><p>Maybe the divide between Housing First and the velvet hammer is a false choice.</p><p>Maybe we don’t have to decide between <em>no rules</em> and <em>all rules</em>.</p><p>Maybe the next step is something else entirely — a <strong>Housing First 2.0</strong>, where stability and transformation don’t compete, but collaborate.</p><p>Where someone gets housed immediately — without preconditions — but is met, <em>right there</em>, with voluntary services that are smart, humane, and persistent. On-site clinics. Peer support. Counseling. Purpose-building. Not imposed, but available. Not forced, but offered again and again.</p><p>A ladder <strong>without the hammer</strong> — but not without scaffolding.</p><p>Because the hammer breaks. The ladder holds.</p><div><hr></div><h4>In Los Angeles, there’s a program called <em>Housing for Health</em>. </h4><p>It doesn’t wait for people to get sober. It houses them. Then wraps them in care. ER visits drop. Jail bookings decline. Many clients <strong>choose</strong> to enter treatment — not because they’re forced, but because someone built trust first.</p><p>In Houston, the city has coordinated housing, healthcare, addiction services, and employment programs across departments. A person experiencing homelessness enters through <em>any</em> door — hospital, jail, outreach — and gets tracked through a shared data system. Services follow them, rather than the other way around.</p><p>It’s not perfect. But it’s working.</p><p>Because it starts with the same assumption Housing First made two decades ago: <strong>you can’t heal without a home</strong>.</p><p>But then it builds out — not back — from there.</p><div><hr></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><h4>Let’s be honest. Housing First didn’t end homelessness. </h4><p>It never claimed it would. What it did was move the moral bar.</p><p>It said: <strong>you don’t have to be good to deserve shelter. You just have to be human.</strong></p><p>That’s still true.</p><p>But it’s also true that some people need more than a roof. They need structure. Support. Maybe even spiritual help. Not because they’re broken — but because they’re people. And people thrive in relationship, in community, in purpose.</p><p>So the real question isn’t <em>Housing First or treatment first</em>.<br> It’s: <em>What if we designed a system that didn’t make us choose?</em></p><p>A system that gave everyone the dignity of housing…<br> And the opportunity to climb — not under threat, but with help.</p><p>A ladder with handrails.<br>Not a velvet hammer.</p><div><hr></div><p></p><h4>Curtis never gets back into housing.</h4><p>He’s still in Portland. Still near that same overpass. His caseworker left the agency after the funding freeze. Freckles — the dog — is still alive, still sleeping at his side.</p><p>What happened to Curtis wasn’t a policy failure.</p><p>It was a <strong>worldview shift</strong>.</p><p>An entire country changed its answer to one question:<br> <em>What do we owe someone who’s suffering?</em></p><p>And maybe the next time we ask that question —<br> We don’t swing a hammer.</p><p>Maybe we just extend the ladder a little farther down.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Coda: After the Fall</strong></h1><p>What do you do when the ladder is gone?</p><p>That’s the question facing cities, service providers, and millions of people — most of whom don’t yet realize they’re next.</p><p>Because what’s happening in U.S. housing policy right now isn’t just a shift. It’s a rupture.</p><p>The federal safety net — thin and tattered to begin with — is being <strong>strategically unraveled</strong> in real time. Not because of oversight. But by design.</p><p>Let’s be clear.</p><p>This isn’t a story about budget cuts.<br> It’s a story about <strong>ideological engineering</strong> — about the deliberate <strong>withdrawal of the state from the business of compassion</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><p>Since President Trump’s return to office in January 2025, here’s what we’ve seen:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</strong> has been <strong>gutted</strong>.<br> Staff slashed by 50%. Programs frozen. Grants canceled mid-cycle. The agency’s digital presence — its public-facing website — cut by 90%, citing “low traffic.”</p></li><li><p>A <strong>DOGE task force</strong> (the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency”) has been charged with dismantling what it calls “ideologically biased” programs. In practice, that means scrapping anything associated with Housing First, racial equity, or public health housing initiatives.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule</strong> — the backbone of proactive civil rights enforcement in housing — is gone.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>FHA</strong> has implemented new restrictions on citizenship and residency, effectively disqualifying many immigrant families from accessing mortgages or public housing programs. HUD and DHS are now coordinating to bar undocumented immigrants from any housing assistance, full stop.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong> — the agency meant to ensure fair lending — has been hollowed out, defunded, and is in the final stages of closure.</p></li></ul><p>This isn’t death by bureaucracy.</p><p>It’s the death of the bureaucracy that kept people alive.</p><div><hr></div><h4>And these aren’t just federal abstractions.</h4><p>They’re the quiet policies that will reshape <strong>who gets to live indoors</strong> — and who doesn’t.</p><p>The collapse will not be cinematic. It will be bureaucratic. Invisible.<br> A mother denied a housing voucher because the agency doesn’t have staff to process the application.<br> A vet sleeping in a car while waiting for a caseworker who was laid off last month.<br> A hospital overrun because HUD can’t fund the scattered-site program that used to keep its most vulnerable patients housed.</p><p>We’re not heading toward crisis.<br> We are already in it.</p><p>We just haven’t looked down.</p><div><hr></div><h4>Here’s what’s likely to happen next.</h4><p>As the Trump administration continues to gut housing programs, impose ideological restrictions on aid, and silence regulatory agencies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Homelessness will spike</strong>, dramatically and visibly — not just in major cities, but in suburbs and rural areas that never had shelter systems to begin with.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emergency rooms and jails</strong> will become our de facto housing providers — again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Public school systems</strong> will see more homeless students than at any time in modern history. And many of them will come from families who were, until recently, housed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elder homelessness</strong> — already rising — will explode, as federal disability and social security systems erode alongside housing aid.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immigrant and mixed-status families</strong> will be pushed out of both public and private housing markets.</p></li><li><p>And <strong>mutual aid networks</strong>, church groups, and overwhelmed nonprofits will become the last remaining social infrastructure for millions — many of whom have never needed help before.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h4>What’s most disturbing isn’t that this is happening.<br> It’s that there is <strong>no contingency plan</strong>.</h4><p>No “Project 2026.”<br>No off-ramp.<br>No national conversation about what happens when an entire generation of renters loses their last line of protection.</p><p>We are watching the infrastructure of decency disassembled in broad daylight — by people who insist that this is what freedom looks like.</p><p>And so the future, for now, looks like this:</p><p>More suffering.<br>More invisible deaths.<br>More moral stories told about the undeserving poor.<br>More hammers. Fewer ladders.</p><div><hr></div><h4>But.</h4><p>There is something else that happens when a society falls.<br> Something quieter than protest.<br> More resilient than outrage.</p><p><em>Memory.</em></p><p>We will remember what worked.<br>We will remember who told the truth.<br>We will remember that Housing First was never perfect — but it was a leap forward in moral reasoning.<br>That it said, at its core: <em>Start with care. Then build everything else.<br></em>That it trusted stability as the first act of transformation.</p><p>We will remember that the people who were most harmed by this rollback weren’t lazy. They weren’t broken.<br>They were human.</p><p>Just… human. <br>All too human.</p><div><hr></div><h4>So here’s what I want to leave you with:</h4><p>As the ladder collapses and the hammer keeps swinging, we are living in the early days of the next system.</p><p>Not the one that’s collapsing.</p><p>The one that <strong>comes after</strong>.</p><p>The one we will need to build when this era ends — because it <em>will</em> end.</p><p>When the funding is gone.<br> When the data is destroyed.<br> When the services are broken, and then slowly rebuilt — not because it was politically wise, but because it became <strong>morally necessary</strong>.</p><p>When people who once looked away now look in the mirror and see someone they love on the other side of the housing crisis.</p><p>That’s when we begin again.</p><p>And if we’re wise, we’ll build that next system <strong>with the knowledge of who we once failed.</strong></p><p>With housing, yes. But also with humanity.</p><p>And next time?</p><p>We build the ladder to last.</p><div><hr></div><p>This has been <em>The Ladder and the Hammer</em>.</p><p>Take care of each other.</p>
