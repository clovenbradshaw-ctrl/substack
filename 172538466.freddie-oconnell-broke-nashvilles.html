particular department leader. Grounded in evidence from hard fought public records requests obtained by people like me, and buttressed by astounding testimony rendered across three Metro Council meetings last month, it cites specific transactions totaling in the millions of dollars that appear problematic. It points to nearly a year of a facility serving our most vulnerable, operated with no contract, all while documented cases of violence, injury, and property damage took place outside of any public view or oversight.</p><p>All this in the context that Metro’s homelessness system is, by any reasonable metric, <em>broken</em>. Despite a two fold increase in funding since 2021, an exploding workforce of full-time city funded homeless serving staffers, Nashville is recording no increase in placing people in permanent housing. <strong>In fact, the only metric that has moved alongside funding is the number of people displaced from encampments</strong> and put somewhere else in the city — <em>virtually never with any form of permanent housing.</em></p><p>A person might ask, maybe someone who cares for the well being of our vulnerable neighbors, or maybe someone who cares about having any real ROI on our public investments: <strong>What the hell is going on here?</strong></p><p>Well, to understand where we are, we need to talk about how we got there. There are several narratives to explain this situation. </p><p>One is a conspiracy theory, absurd and non-sensical, but useful for framing this as a problem caused by the very people sounding the alarm about this crisis. It is a theory popular with the conservative wing of the Metro Council, claiming that it is <em>in fact</em> the advocates for the unhoused who are somehow tanking the city’s efforts to end homelessness, doing so out of their own pecuniary self-interest. If homelessness were solved, they’d be out of a job! And “solving homelessness”, we assume, would be just around the corner if not for them short circuiting it by advocating for… housing for the unhoused. Don’t think too hard about it, its more vibes than logic. It's a cousin to theories and dissent curbing rhetoric promulgated by Koch and Exxon-funded American Enterprise Institute with its “<a href="https://www.aei.org/good-neighbors-index/">Good Neighbor Index</a>”, and one that falls apart on this simplest interrogation. But its purpose, like most conspiracy theories, isn't actually to explain things — it's to make you stop looking for the real answers </p><p>The other narrative is also a conspiracy — but a less absurd one. Less of a <em>theory</em> and more of an extremely consistent set of observations. It goes like this: either through explicit plans and intentions, or from overlapping decisions stemming from the same set of neoliberal values that do not trust communities to act in their own best interests, <strong>Nashville’s homeless serving system was reshaped in a way that consolidated power in one central node — </strong><em><strong>and then broke it.</strong></em></p><p>That central position of power, whether it gained this power intentionally or not, became uniquely able to solve one of the most intractable problems that faces the most powerful forces in Nashville. That problem is not actually <em>homelessness. </em>The real problem that needs solving, judging by the actions of the system in the past few years, is social and political forces that treat homelessness <em>as a problem that needs solving,</em> and require that this be done in a humane, sustainable way<em>.</em></p><p>Having the power to resolve the conflict that happens when the city's most powerful and most vulnerable go head to head is an unparalleled arrow to have in your quiver. For a long time it has been quite complicated to just “get rid of homeless people” and deal with the blowback that comes from this. The blowback tends to not come from the unhoused themselves, who have little political agency and public visibility of their own, but rather from advocates for them who push back against treating the unhoused as if they were an origin-less scourge on what would otherwise be a flourishing metropolis populated exclusively by millionaires and tourists.</p><p>There is an axiom of systems theory that goes: “A system is what it does.” And for all the liberal niceness about progressivism that our civic leaders present, the system they have built, <strong>measured by what it actually does</strong>, is anything but <em>progressive</em>. What the outcomes demonstrate, what the documentary evidence shows, is that this is not a system interested in solving homelessness. It's a system, judged by its action not its rhetoric, that is designed to bulldoze over any and all policies, best practices, lived experience, community oversight and any form of accountability, so that the may city do what it wants with unhoused people. And that’s a very compelling campaign promise.</p><p>As is the wont of despotic impulses when they manifest in a liberal context, the cravenness comes out sideways. Where conservative leaders are able to openly flaunt their tyrannical impulses, liberals cling to to the veneer of technocratic civility, justifying their autocracy because they, or at least the consultants they’ve hired, <em>know best.</em> Liberal leadership conflates the personality trait of <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/emotional-stability">emotional stability</a> </em>for<em> </em>intellectual rigor and rigid professionalism for competency, inevitably building brittle, anto-democractic hierarchies ripe for authoritarian conquest.</p><p>Perhaps the original sin of liberalism is it’s deep overconfidence that they understand human nature. They believe authoritarians can be <em>reasoned with</em>. Yet paradoxically the believe that people who demonstrate <em>passion</em> about their causes (a term typically reserved for people of color and/or women) are wonderful <em>cheerleaders for change</em>, but are not ultimately capable of reason because they don’t have the… je ne sais quoi… Ivy League degrees that make them appropriate to <em>actually </em>have a say in decision making.</p><p>What is unavoidable is that in Nashville, the power to unilaterally <em>deal with</em> <em>the unhoused</em> has been accumulated, something senior officials act as if it just <em>happened to them.</em> This is a power that is conspicuously desirable for anyone who would want to court the favor of Nashville’s conservative plutocratic developer class, considered the key demographic to obtain and maintain political power in Nashville — worth, apparently, tossing away all left wing solidarity, progressivist bona fides, and personal relationships.</p><p><strong>But things weren't always this way.</strong> </p><p>Over the past half decade, the official entity that oversees all homelessness strategy in Nashville, the Continuum of Care, was redesigned. Its autonomy was stripped and all four of its main functions, one by one, has been consolidated under control by Metro Nashville. Increasingly, Metro Legal is ruling that the all elements of the CoC, comprised of volunteers from independent non-profits, are an extension of Metro government and must follow their narrow interpretations of public meetings laws and forbidding compensation in any context for people with lived experience to aide the CoC. </p><p>And that last piece is perhaps the whole game in a nutshell. Metro’s colonization of the CoC has created a paradigm where <em>those who are actually impacted by homelessness</em> and need a modicum of compensation to get public transportation, childcare, or time off their hourly wage work, are being prevented from participating in the very system allegedly designed <em>for them.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YA2p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YA2p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YA2p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YA2p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YA2p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg" width="743" height="749" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70d353de-c17d-40f7-a2a7-031b33282c1f_743x749.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:743,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;If all organising is disorganising and reorganising -

What is offered on topics like this, directly parallel to the sudden inability of Metro to pay individual artists for Thrive grants during at Metro Arts, is mealy mouthed technocratic doublespeak from overqualified Metro Legal lackeys who probably imagined using their J.D. in public service would be noble, and involve more than telling people poor people who want to protect their friends and families from unaccountable municipal overreach that they’re shit-out-of-luck. </p><p>It is important to say, perhaps it is my ethical duty to clarify, but I am truly loathe to do it (and believe me when I say I’ve done my best to not have to say this so explicitly in hopes we could just tidy this up behind the scenes) — that one of the chief architects of this redesign, the person who wrote the very legislation that created The Office of Homeless Services, who solely sponsored the no-contest consulting report grant that argued for this vertical integration, and perhaps more to the point, the person who benefitted the most from this consolidating of power and resources, is <strong>Mayor Freddie O’Connell.</strong></p><p>No one person could arguably have been more central to the design and execution of a system that has utterly failed to improve, in even the most modest ways, outcomes for the unhoused. All despite funding growth whose explosiveness, and harm to the unhoused of Nashville, is matched perhaps only to the Nashville Downtown Partnership’s demolition of the Downtown Library Parking Garage.</p><p>We need to look at what OHS has been doing the last few years, <em>and we need to look hard</em>. But we also need to ask, how did a leader who ran as “Nashville’s only truly progressive candidate” perform such a incomprehensible heel turn? Whether intentional or not, he has sold out well-being of the most vulnerable Nashvillians to gain <em>something</em>.</p><p>I can only hope it was worth it.</p><p></p><div

Moment:</strong></p><p>Nashville stands at a critical juncture. Across the nation, rigid institutional hierarchies are proving vulnerable to authoritarian capture. Systems that concentrate power while performing democratic theater are precisely the structures that fail when tested. We need leadership that understands this danger and builds resilient, distributed governance before it's too late.</p><p><strong>Core Philosophy:</strong></p><p>This role requires someone who recognizes that grand master plans rarely work. Instead, we need multiple small experiments that can adapt, fail safely, and teach us what actually functions in Nashville's specific context. The goal isn't perfection—it's building systems resilient enough to resist capture and flexible enough to improve.</p><p><strong>Primary Responsibilities:</strong></p><p><strong>Implement Real Financial Transparency</strong></p><ul><li><p>Start with what peer cities already do: searchable online databases of all city expenditures</p></li><li><p>Require quarterly reporting from all Metro-funded entities, including quasi-governmental nonprofits</p></li><li><p>Make the Downtown Partnership's 20 years of unreviewed budgets finally face actual oversight</p></li><li><p>Create automatic triggers where successful programs expand unless explicitly stopped in public view</p></li><li><p>Design systems where hiding information requires more effort than revealing it</p></li></ul><p><strong>Reform Housing Policy Through Practical Steps</strong></p><ul><li><p>Acknowledge that market-based solutions have failed and will continue to fail</p></li><li><p>Start small, proven pilots rather than comprehensive overhauls:</p><ul><li><p>Launch Nashville's first community land trust in one neighborhood</p></li><li><p>Convert underused city property into social housing with resident input</p></li><li><p>Test limited equity cooperatives as an ownership model</p></li><li><p>Create right of first refusal policies for tenants when buildings go up for sale</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Measure success by permanent exits from homelessness, not displacement metrics</p></li><li><p>End encampment sweeps that simply shuffle people around without housing them</p></li></ul><p><strong>Restore Distributed Decision-Making in Homelessness Services</strong></p><ul><li><p>Return real authority to the Continuum of Care rather than centralizing all power in Metro</p></li><li><p>Ensure service providers share data horizontally, not just report upward</p></li><li><p>Include people with lived experience in policy decisions, with fair compensation</p></li><li><p>Stop prioritizing encampment clearances for development projects over the coordinated entry list</p></li><li><p>Build evaluation systems where those receiving services judge effectiveness</p></li></ul><p><strong>Build Practical Community Safety Infrastructure</strong></p><ul><li><p>Create an independent Office of Violence Prevention to coordinate across departments</p></li><li><p>Fund evidence-based programs across three timeframes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Stable employment, youth programs, mental health services</p></li><li><p><strong>Intervention:</strong> Credible messenger programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, survivor support</p></li><li><p><strong>Interruption:</strong> Violence interrupters, hospital-based response teams</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Start with pilot programs in willing neighborhoods before city-wide implementation</p></li><li><p>Develop crisis response teams with mental health professionals, not just police</p></li><li><p>Move Nashville from 40% on the Violence Prevention Index toward implementing proven programs</p></li></ul><p><strong>Restart Democratic Participation</strong></p><ul><li><p>Revive participatory budgeting with dedicated staff and genuine community control</p></li><li><p>Begin with 2-3 council districts willing to allocate portions of discretionary funds</p></li><li><p>Create neighborhood assemblies that generate solutions, not just feedback</p></li><li><p>Build in mechanisms where affected communities shape policies, not just comment</p></li><li><p>Document what works and expand gradually based on evidence</p></li></ul><p><strong>Foster Alternative Economic Models</strong></p><ul><li><p>Support worker cooperatives through city procurement preferences</p></li><li><p>Explore public banking to keep public money circulating locally</p></li><li><p>Test time banks and mutual aid networks in interested neighborhoods</p></li><li><p>Create pathways for worker ownership when privatizing city services</p></li><li><p>Measure success through wellbeing indicators, not just growth metrics</p></li></ul><p><strong>Required Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Minimum 30 years of age by start of term</p></li><li><p>Davidson County resident for 3+ continuous years</p></li><li><p>Must maintain residency throughout term</p></li></ul><p><strong>Essential Capacities:</strong></p><p>We need someone who:</p><ul><li><p>Understands that concentrated power invites capture while distributed power resists it</p></li><li><p>Knows housing is a human right and will build policies accordingly</p></li><li><p>Recognizes that communities closest to problems often have the best solutions</p></li><li><p>Can distinguish between managing existing systems and building alternatives</p></li><li><p>Will start with small experiments rather than grand plans</p></li><li><p>Believes transparency and accountability must be built into systems, not bolted on</p></li><li><p>Can work with the reality of Nashville's politics while pushing for genuine change</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Urgency:</strong></p><p>Nashville cannot afford another term of progressive rhetoric without structural change. We need someone who will build alternative systems now—starting small, learning fast, and scaling what works. The question isn't whether current systems will face pressure, but whether we'll have resilient alternatives in place when they do.</p><p><strong>Application Process:</strong></p><p>[Standard municipal application requirements]</p><p>Come prepared to discuss specific first steps, not comprehensive plans. Show us you understand the difference between managing power and distributing it. Demonstrate that you know how to build with communities, not just for them.</p><p>Nashville needs someone who can build working alternatives, not perfect systems.</p>
