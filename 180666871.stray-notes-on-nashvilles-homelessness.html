<p>I’m bad at keeping organized notes, so I’m just going to leave this here so I can find it easier in the future. These are some questions I’ve been mulling over, and if you’ve got the time, feel free to take a crack at answering them (or responding if you know the answer!)</p><p>I’ve asked these to some of the relevant parties and I feel like it wasn’t appreciated, or that the way I asked wasn’t appreciated. But a question is useless if you keep it to yourself, so I’ll just post it here and see where the wind takes it. This isn’t exactly the strategy one takes for “gotcha” journalism, but that’s not something I’ve been interested in.</p><p>Really, I’m interested in our systems learning and our leaders being their best selves. And that requires feedback. Feedback often takes the form of assertions, but it can also take the form of questions. These are the kinds of things I’m thinking about.
