<p>If it has seemed odd to you that I’ve been going non-stop about how we’re using our public resources on homelessness, I want to tell you why this matters so urgently — and why it matters to <em>you</em>, even if you’ve never been unhoused.</p><p>Because as of this morning, we are going to have <strong>vastly, vastly less</strong> of those resources. And what remains will be used in ways that will hurt the most vulnerable among us first — and the rest of us soon after.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.

Think of it like your family budget suddenly getting cut by two-thirds, and someone telling you the remaining third can only be spent on things that haven’t worked before.</p><p>Here’s what changed:</p><p>The “safe” funding cities could count on dropped from 90% to 30%. Programs that have been helping people for years — even good ones — now have to compete nationally for what’s left. Most will lose. People will be fired. A non-insignificant number of those fired, already working under subsistence wages, will now become clients of the homeless support agencies they once worked for.</p><p>Cities that invested in giving people “housing first” (the model we spent $750k in consulting fees to an out-of-state vendor selected by the city’s COO and sponsored by then Council Member O’Connell) are now told they can only spend 30% of their money that way. If we had actually done housing first, we might be in a better place. But we didn’t. But since all of our programming claims its housing first, we’re in quite a pickle. </p><p>Our leaders, acting autonomously, aggregating power only for themselves, frankly, <em>they fucked us.</em></p><p>Here is HUD’s new priority: detention. Treatment and work requirements you cannot refuse, in facilities you functionally cannot leave, miles from anywhere, enforced by police who will arrest you for sleeping anywhere else. Utah is spending $75 million on exactly this model, Louisiana is legislating forced labor for camping violations, and HUD says they’re “encouraged.” They’re calling them “transformational campuses.” The rest of us should call them what they are.</p><h2>Why This Is Personal for Me</h2><p>I’ve spent months documenting how Nashville wasted $50 million on a “Housing First strategy” that was corrupted from the start — money hoarded by people who faced no consequences when it failed, money that often harmed the very people it was supposed to help.</p><p>Housing First, when done right, can work. Can work <em>extraordinarily</em> well.</p><p>But when it’s run by people who profit from its failure, when there’s no accountability, when the community being served has no say in how resources are used — it becomes just another way to funnel public money to private interests.</p><p>And now? The federal government has made it nearly impossible to do Housing First at all, even when done right. So what are we going to do with what limited funding we have left.</p><p>Why <em>on earth</em> would we trust the same people who misspent $50M to manage our vastly diminished funds.</p><h2>The Canary in the Coal Mine</h2><p>Here’s what you need to understand: I’m not doing this work because I only care about homelessness policy.</p><p>I’m doing it because the unhoused are the canary in the coal mine.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

devolve to always talking about you-know-who. So let’s look at some context, but I’ll redact who I’m talking about and see if any of this clicks for you.</p><p>In 1933 in a country in Europe, there was leadership change. The policies of this new administration impacted many demographics, but an under-discussed one is who was immediately targeted.</p><blockquote><p>The term “asocials” was very vague and used to label a wide range of people, for example poor people, homeless, alcoholics or other drug addicts, prostitutes, homosexuals, people not coming to work or coming late, and people living, in the eyes of the <strong>[REDACTED]</strong>, a so-called nonconformist life. The term “career criminal” often didn’t mean people who committed violent felonies. For example, a teenager from a poor family who was caught shoplifting a few times could be labeled as a habitual or career criminal. There are even cases of the  <strong>[REDACTED]</strong> deporting young men with no previous criminal records to concentration camps because local police officers predicted they would have a future criminal career.</p><p>But, after 1933, these ideas became the basis of welfare, healthcare and criminology, and the police gained enormous power over the judicial process. Starting in January 1934, the police could take individuals into preventive detention without a court ruling and deport them to concentration camps, labeling them as habitual or career criminals.<br><br><strong>Strangers to the Community: “Asocials” and Career Criminals <br></strong><em><strong>(Gemeinschaftsfremde: Asoziale und Berufsverbrecher)</strong></em></p><p><a href="https://considerthesourceny.org/teaching-holocaust-and-genocide/holocaust-resources-time-period/persecution-and-segregation/readings/asocials">considerthesourceny.org</a></p></blockquote><p>Things did not end well for the “asocial” that were placed into camps. At least <a href="https://www.camps.bbk.ac.uk/documents/049-social-outsiders.html">1,200 “asocial</a>” men died in concentration camps between January 1938 and August 1939, and “during 1942-43 some 6,000 ‘asocial’ prisoners were exterminated through work programme’s in concentration camps.” (<a href="https://libapp.shadygrove.umd.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/the-era-of-the-holocaust/asocial-prisoners">libapp.shadygrove.umd.edu</a>)</p><p>The unhoused are the people with the least power in our society today. Along with immigrants. Along with gender non-conforming people. Along with anyone our society has decided doesn’t matter.</p><p><strong>They always get it first. The cruelty, the budget cuts, the criminalization, the scapegoating.</strong></p><p>When politicians and profiteers want to test how much they can get away with — how much public money they can waste, how many lives they can destroy, how brazenly they can lie about it — they start with the people nobody will defend.</p><p>If we let them do it to the unhoused without consequence, they’ll do it to everyone else next. They’ll do it to your schools. Your healthcare. Your roads. Your water. Every public resource that’s supposed to serve us all.</p><p>You watched the glee with which the shut down SNAP. And the handwringing with which our “Democrats” couldn’t figure out how to even make the buses temporarily free in response.</p><p>The question isn’t whether you personally have been homeless. The question is whether you’re willing to watch them perfect the playbook on the most vulnerable before they use it on you.</p><h2>This Will Be a Generational Disaster</h2><p>For the unhoused themselves, obviously, they’ll die. That’s not metaphor. People will die. Far, far more than necessary.</p><p>For the business elites and politicians who think clearing encampments makes the problem disappear — it doesn’t. It just moves people around until they run out of places to move.</p><p>For people who don’t want to see poverty in public spaces near their homes — you’re about to see a lot more of it, because the programs that actually moved people indoors are being defunded.</p><p>For the social workers and case managers doing this work out of genuine care — they’re about to be laid off or forced to become agents of criminalization.</p><p>For all of us who depend on public resources working the way they’re supposed to — this is the test case for how bad it can get.</p><h2>How Decisions Are Currently Made</h2><p>As a former Mayor’s Office employee and now an investigative spelunker of Metro’s absurd inefficiencies, let me explain as succinctly as possible how decisions currently are made, and why.</p><p>Our chief bureaucrats—the Mayor, the Chief of Staff, the County COO—have corporate backgrounds. They’re running Nashville like a corporation.</p><p><strong>A corporation is, by definition, a dictatorship.</strong> A CEO with hire/fire power over department heads. Ultimate say. Top-down control. No community input that can’t be ignored.</p><p>Except the CEO reports to someone: the investors.</p><p>In Nashville, the “investors” aren’t you. They’re the Chamber of Commerce. The real estate lobby. Registered lobbyists with deep pockets and shallow interest in solutions that work long-term. We know their names. We see them at council. Their photos and clients <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/sites/default/files/2025-10/lobbyist-photos_10-20-2025.pdf?ct=1760989470">are publicly available</a> by TN state law.</p><p><strong>That’s who gets listened to. That’s who decisions are made for.</strong></p><p>You can’t run a city like a corporation because a city isn’t trying to maximize shareholder value—it’s trying to serve everyone. Those goals aren’t just different, they’re opposed.</p><p>The corporate model isn’t failing. It’s working exactly as designed—just not for us.</p><h2>What Happens Next Is Up To You</h2><ul><li><p>If you are in senior leadership in philanthropy and watching this trainwreck unfold—</p></li><li><p>If you are a business leader who doesn’t want our city swamped with unhoused people who will eventually be rounded up and put into involuntary detention centers—</p></li><li><p>If you are a concerned citizen who hasn’t been otherwise invested but can see where this is heading—</p></li><li><p>If you are the Mayor of Metro Nashville who has been providing the sole oversight of a homelessness system that, with $50 million of funding to use as it pleased, has frittered it away into nothing—</p></li></ul><p><strong>Human decency, common sense, civic virtue, Tennessee pride, and your own political self-interest are all aligned in one direction</strong>: We must fundamentally revisit how we decide how to leverage our collective resources.</p><p>The federal government just showed us the future. Utah’s $75 million camp. Louisiana’s forced labor. San Diego’s displacement machine dressed up as success.

homelessness—the unhoused themselves, the neighbors who live near shelters, the social workers doing the actual work, the small business owners dealing with the daily reality—have real power over how resources are used.</p><p>Not token “input.” Not performative “lived experience” panels that get ignored when decisions are made. Real power. Real accountability. Real consequences for waste and failure.</p><p>Come prepared to explain why you should continue controlling resources when you’ve failed to use them effectively. Come prepared to show your work. Come prepared to justify every dollar you’ve spent and every outcome you’ve failed to achieve.</p><p>Because if you don’t come to the table voluntarily, we will continue in the long line of everyday
