<p>This feed has had a lot going on of late.</p><p>A platform for the raw materials to do a “community audit” of the Office of Homeless Services. </p><p>A deep dive on the closing of Old Tent City. </p><p>Updates about another rushed encampment closure set off by fireworks. </p><p>An analysis of how the Big Beautiful Bill is the cursed spiritual step-child of TN Governor Phil Bredesen’s slashing of Tenncare in 2005, but with exponentially more dire downstream effects for the future of the state.</p><p>Some quick turnaround deep dives into Business Improvement Districts and revelations about $60M+ in neglected oversight by Metro Council (something talking points are already emerging to downplay and explain away). </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>An aside about this last thing.</strong></p><p>I had a conversation with Michele Flynn about this which posted yesterday, and her post on the topic and our conversation seems to be causing quite a semantic debate on what counts as “review and approve” means, and how to fix what looks to be like $60M+ oversight going back over two decades.</p><p>Feedback sent to her from a Metro Council Member:</p><blockquote><p>They have sent their budget breakdown to the Finance Department every year, and that information has been available if a council member or community member wanted to ask for it . Now that the breakdown in actually reporting to council has been pointed out, that has been corrected, and we will be on the look-out for a budget detail by April 15 of every year.</p></blockquote><p>The online convo about it has also been kinda inflammatory, with Jelly Roll songs and Fake News gifs counting as public discourse.</p><div

colonialism. jk. sorta). But I’m not a lawyer either, and don’t have expertise on what counts as “proper authorization of funds” — I’m just doing my best to read the rules like everyone else and pass along public info. </p><p>Since this is definitely above my pay grade, I’ve gone ahead and looped in who might be the right people to look into this issue. </p><p>This morning I left a message with the TN Waste Fraud and Abuse line today (1.800.232.5454) to see if this is a <em>them</em> thing. </p><p>I also sent them the below attached message through their <a href="https://apps.cot.tn.gov/ants/submission/submit">online form</a>. Maybe they can clear this all up and show us that it’s NBD. Or maybe they’ll make some specific corrective actions for Metro — either way this seems like the proper channel for us to figure out what to do next.

Much of it has been turned around on short notice and little sleep.</p><p>There’s been more collaboration than ever before with this content, but also a lot just on my shoulders. That last part is on me — some people have been thanking me for this work, but notably no one is <em>demanding</em> it of me.</p><p>Some quotes have been ringing in my head of late. There’s an intense tension between two voices inside me, and it’s showing up in my personal life in ways that aren’t sustainable.</p><p><strong>One side shouts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed; everything else is public relations!</p></li><li><p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has!</p></li><li><p>Comfort the afflicted! Afflict the comfortable!</p></li></ul><p><strong>The other side whispers:</strong></p><ul><li><p>We must believe we are worthy of rest. We don’t have to earn it. It is our birth‑right.</p></li><li><p>Caring for myself is not self‑indulgence, it is self‑preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.</p></li><li><p>It takes courage to say yes to rest and play in a culture where exhaustion is seen as a status symbol.</p></li></ul><p>I’m taking a little break to listen to the whispers better, and hopefully I can comeback with more of a <strong>both/and</strong> headspace. I don’t know what that integrated voice sounds like right now.</p><p>I was told an adage recently that’s said in high end restaurants: “Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.”</p><p>I need this to all be smoother. Fewer typos. Fewer last minute things rushed out. More intentional collaboration. More experiments in storytelling with testing before release. </p><p>I’m aiming for two weeks off from all this.</p><p>I think I just heard a deep collective sigh of relief from our city’s bureaucrats and business class.</p><p>I need some time to figure out what I want from this platform that we’ve built together. If you’ve valued this work, feel free to consider ask that of yourself: what would you want from this combination megaphone and movement journalism outlet we’ve built together?</p><p>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:michaeltlacy@gmail.com">michaeltlacy@gmail.com</a> with your ideas.</p><p>And I don’t really say it enough (and I plan on doing so more soon with some very specific projects we can all do together) but if you value what I do here and you can spare it, throw me a few bucks. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Right now I make $65.50 a month doing this. And honestly that’s amazing and I never expected it and I’m deeply grateful for it. And also, it only just covers the gas I pay driving around doing these projects. </p><p>I need to get better at asking people to pitch in if we want to keep doing this together. Feeling like this is my burden to do and take on all the risk as some sort of moral obligation is a “me thing” to figure out.</p><p>So I’m gonna be off the grid this weekend, and going to be pressing pause on posting for a couple of weeks.<br><br>But I’m going to come back with some new ideas and projects we can do together. Probably less “breaking news” and more “collaboratively redesigning systems.”</p><p>Catch you on the flipside.</p><p>-Mike</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>You know I wrote this and sent it out, “I don’t want to be confused as journalist,” and I thought “what do I mean by that?” There definitely is journalism in what I’ve been doing. I’ve been investigating things and writing about them in that style, citing sources and quoting people. Maybe it’s best understood as “movement journalism”? (Worth looking that up, I only just learned about the concept.) But I give too much point of view and commentary to qualify as journalism in a New York Times way. Maybe it’s acknowledging that I’m not trained in this at all and am not part of a professional organization? It’s an open question for me, part of what I’d like to find out these next two weeks with time off. Feel free to give me your thoughts on what it is you think am doing, even if you think it’s something I need to stop doing. </p></div></div>
