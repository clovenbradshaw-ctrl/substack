<h1>The Cult Of Free Market Housing Nonsense</h1><p>If you want to understand why Nashville’s homelessness response feels like it’s designed to serve developers—not people—you have to trace the logic back to pleaces like the <strong>American Enterprise Institute (AEI)</strong>.</p><p>In the next piece, I’ll dig into AEI’s specific claims and the way it has recruited local leaders into its orbit—leaders who should be strengthening proven strategies to end homelessness but instead end up undercutting them. That includes Nashville’s own Director of the Office of Homeless Services, who has spoken at AEI conferences, and who in turn brought an AEI-backed presenter to this year’s Metro-funded State of Homelessness Symposium.</p><p>This isn’t idle think-tank chatter. AEI’s housing leadership is<a href="https://www.hud.gov/news/hud-no-25-092"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.hud.gov/news/hud-no-25-092">literally being cited in the policy of the current Trump administration</a></strong>—policies that have rolled back protections against racial bias in home appraisals and justified firing every federal housing employee whose work touched racial equity.</p><p>Now its Housing Center is exporting the same market-first ideology into local debates. Its flagship tool, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250818203017/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6623c0eba3e87f3f0474127b/t/673f47860660175d0990dcdd/1732200329625/24.11+Good+Neighbors+v1.pdf">Good Neighbor Index</a></strong>, insists homelessness isn’t a human rights crisis at all but a data point—a predictable byproduct of “displacement pressure” when home prices outpace incomes. The fix, in their telling, is not public housing or long-term supports, but deregulation: “releasing the swarm” of small developers, legalizing ADUs, and making sure housing stays firmly inside the private market.</p><h4>AEI’s Housing Doctrine: Supply, Not Shelter</h4><p>The AEI Housing Center mission statement: <em>“develop market-based solutions to the nation’s shortage of economical housing.”</em> They emphasize deregulation, land-use changes, and private finance—not public housing or subsidies.<br>👉 <a href="https://www.aei.org/centers/housing-center/">AEI Housing Center</a></p><p>In their own words: <em>“The solution to making housing more affordable lies in adding more housing supply, not in easy credit and market-distorting subsidies.”</em><br>👉 <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/market-oriented-housing-reform-principles-and-policies-that-would-help/">Market-Oriented Housing Reform Principles</a></p><p>On public housing and vouchers: <em>“Public housing projects have become known for dilapidation and crime, while federal housing vouchers have encouraged dependency and discouraged property maintenance and upgrades.”</em><br>👉 <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/public-housing-and-rental-subsidies/">Public Housing and Rental Subsidies</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Nashville Speaks AEI—Loudly</h3><p>This isn’t just theoretical alignment—it’s explicit:</p><p><strong>April Calvin</strong>, Nashville’s OHS director, spoke at AEI’s <em>Good Neighbors</em> event on housing data and homelessness.<br>👉 <a href="https://www.aei.org/events/good-neighbors-using-housing-data-to-reframe-homelessness/">AEI Good Neighbors Event</a></p><p><strong>Major Ethan Frizzell</strong>, a Salvation Army officer and <a href="https://www.ethanfrizzell.com/">AEI “Catalyst Analyzer,</a>” also presented AEI-backed approaches like the Good Neighbor Index.</p><p>Frizzell also gave a presentation at Nashville’s 2025 Metro-sponsored Symposium. His AEI-backed talk was essentially a polished, Nashville-tailored version of AEI’s national housing gospel: deregulate, flood the market with small-scale development, and treat services as navigation back into commodified housing. It avoids any framing of housing as a right or public infrastructure.<br><br>As I’ll discuss more in the next post, the insidious thing about AEI’s anti-equity, burn down the social safety net rhetoric turn game plan is that it makes some solid points about the uselessness of middling centrist liberal policies at making things better.</p><p>Were the maniacs at AEI to read Mayor O’Connell’s Unified Housing Solutions and its incentives-driven approach to tackling homelessness, we’d likely agree that liberal projects like that are next to useless at addressing underlying cause.</p><p>But that’s where we’d stop agreeing. Judging by many quotes from their top brass about how inequalities of all kind are based on things like genetic differences and low IQ, I don’t think we’d find common ground on solutions.</p><p>What seems obvious to me is that everyone, almost everyone, know what needs to be done.</p><p>We need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decommodification">decommodify</a> housing. But do we have the balls to do it? How could we ever talk ourselves into that?</p>
