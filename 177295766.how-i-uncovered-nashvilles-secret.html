This was based on information I brought to The Nashville Scene after seeing some extremely concerning behavior going on without any oversight. Except, perhaps from the person with sole authority over the Office of Homeless Services, Mayor Freddie O’Connell.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://clovenbradshaw-ctrl.github.io/municpal/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Get Access Now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://clovenbradshaw-ctrl.github.io/municpal/"><span>Get Access Now</span></a></p><p>OHS has been removing families from at least one homeless shelter and placing them into apartments, promising to pay their rent and that they’d receive a housing voucher allowing them to move to any housing that takes these subsidies. </p><p>And then, with no warning, they retracted their promise. What unfolded was crisis. Here are some highlights.</p><ul><li><p>Eviction notices were posted. </p></li><li><p>A case manager at a 3rd party support services organization resigned in protest, citing OHS’s requirements of her to act unethically. </p></li><li><p>A roof literally collapsed on a tenants head.</p></li><li><p>And Nashvillians who thought they’d won the lottery realized they had not actually been handed a golden ticket. And in many ways, their ability to navigate the precarious landscape of homelessness had actually become harder. </p></li></ul><p>It is still unclear why the city did this. And what’s even more baffling is, after such an utter failure of a pilot program for <em>whatever this is,</em> is that <strong>OHS has now allocated $2.4M of city money to expand this operation of “non-traditional rapid rehousing.”</strong></p><p>This term does not exist <em>anywhere </em>in the public literature<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>, in any HUD documents, not even in blogs. The only evidence I can find of it is in Director Calvin’s public statements, and now in the FY</p><p>This has come after exhaustive research and built on reporting happening throughout this years and relationships built slowly overtime. It’s the type of thing that increasingly media doesn’t have the financial incentive to do, and I’ve been doing it on my own dime.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://clovenbradshaw-ctrl.github.io/municpal/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Follow the Investigation&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://clovenbradshaw-ctrl.github.io/municpal/"><span>Follow the Investigation</span></a></p><p>You will be seeing articles about this in media like the Nashville Scene.

She had never set foot in Tennessee before landing at the Nashville Rescue Mission with her young daughter, leaving behind everything they knew in California for the promise of something better.</p><p>“I’ve never been in Nashville. Never been in here until, this is my first time,” she recalls, the memory still fresh despite the months that have passed. The move wasn’t planned—it was necessity. A single mother dealing with severe fibroids that doctors had misdiagnosed since 2018, first as acid reflux, she had been told she couldn’t have children after the fibroids multiplied and enlarged. Her daughter’s very existence defied those medical predictions, and protecting that miracle became her driving force.</p><p>She’d gotten to Nashville with a bus ticket paid by a group out of West Memphis. Nashville was chosen simply because there was room. So limited are the options in our country, that she travelled across nearly its whole length to move into a homeless shelter.</p><p>Without a job and new to the city, she focused on maintaining something she refused to compromise on: her daughter’s education. She’s kept her daughter enrolled in virtual K-12 homeschooling, a decision rooted in both faith and practicality.</p><p>“She’s progressed more than in public school,” she explains. “She was in public school for like a year, she didn’t like it. A lot of distractions.” When she prayed about it, she felt God telling her to keep her daughter in virtual school—a decision she feels was prophetic as school shootings continued making headlines.</p><p>At the shelter, Holly, a case manager, approached her with news that seemed like divine providence: without applying, without even knowing such a program existed, she and her daughter had been selected for special housing assistance through Metro’s Office of Homeless Services. A full year of rent, paid by the city. A housing voucher at the end. A real apartment instead of a shelter bed.</p><p>“They showed up picking you without you applying being like, ‘we’re going to pay your rent for a year,’” is how she describes it now, still incredulous at how it all began.</p><p>The Office of Homeless Services moved quickly. They toured her through facilities, had her sign a lease that OHS then took possession of. No copy for her. No mention of Metro or OHS anywhere on the paperwork—just her name on a document she never could have qualified for on her own. She had no idea she was about to become a test case in Nashville’s shadow housing experiment, or that speaking truth about what happened to her and other families would require the kind of courage that reshapes identities.</p><p>The name on the lease that OHS told her to sign is Kirsney. But she says she’s starting to prefer to go by Esther, from the Bible—the queen who risked everything to expose a plot against her people, who revealed hidden truths to power when staying silent would have been safer.</p><p>Esther’s story, and that of others, will continue to be told as this investigation unfolds.</p><div class="footnote" data-component-name="FootnoteToDOM"><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>I even commissioned AI to perform a deep research report on the term “non-traditional rapid rehousing”, and it came up empty handed.</p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substack.com/img/attachment_icon.svg"></image><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">Non Traditional Rapid Rehousing Investigation Of An Invented Housing Term</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">180KB ∙ PDF file</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/api/v1/file/f2f22f15-c344-4ca1-8e76-b0541b4c46d0.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/api/v1/file/f2f22f15-c344-4ca1-8e76-b0541b4c46d0.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div></div></div>
