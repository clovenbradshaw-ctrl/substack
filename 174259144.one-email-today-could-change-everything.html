People have expressed concerns to me about how truly <em>independent</em> an “Internal Audit” Metro Nashville can perform on itself. But I have faith in democracy, in the messy work of us holding each other accountable through checks and balances. The tensions that arise from these accountability structures are not evidence that our governance <em>is not working</em>, but quite the opposite. </p><p><strong>Attempting to serve our collective needs effectively, not quite getting there, auditing what happened, and learning from our failures </strong><em><strong>is precisely how democracy is supposed to work. </strong></em>The only thing really at stake is our egos, and the illusion that is increasingly difficult to maintain that <em>everything is fine.</em></p><h2>Here’s what else you need to know</h2><p>As you may be aware, I’ve spent the last few months reporting on the homelessness system in Nashville.</p><p><a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/p/housing-last-preface">In my first post on the topic</a>, before I had done any research on the topic, I asked this question about our systems around homelessness.</p><blockquote><p>How humane, intelligible, transparent, democratic, equitable, logical—and just plain helpful—are they?</p><p>The services we have today for the unhoused in Nashville: are these the blueprints we want to follow when we rebuild civilization? Would we want these systems to be done unto us tomorrow as they are being done unto them today?</p></blockquote><p>Over the past few months, I have found things I never expected and I’ve become deeply alarmed by what I discovered. I’ve flagged this personally with senior level officials in Metro Nashville, and have been told repeatedly that this essentially boils down to “personality conflicts” and <em>there’s nothing to see here</em>. But what I’ve brought to the public (and to officials who are supposed to provide oversight) is not a compilation of <em>bad interactions with people who don’t vibe well together.</em> </p><p>In the course of my research, fighting very hard for access to public information that Metro did not appear to want to make public, I found information, written in plain English in the form of contracts, financial transactions, and court documents that frankly shocked me. </p><p><strong>I learned in real time about our systems that sit at the precise intersection of the most vulnerable and the most powerful.</strong> These systems have been turned into opaque, unaccountable, brittle structures that appear designed to effectively serve everyone but the unhoused. But maybe I’m way off base. Let’s find out.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>A Subset of Concerns Raised</strong></h2><p>The audit request letter from Councilmember Ginny Welsch details over $3.2 million in suspected financial irregularities at the Office of Homeless Services. This represents just a fraction of the issues documented - the full request includes extensive footnotes with public records, contracts, and court documents supporting each claim.</p><p>Among the financial concerns highlighted:</p><ul><li><p>$568,923 paid to Depaul USA outside contract dates, with invoices referencing a $1.2 million contract when the actual value was $500,000</p></li><li><p>$565,577 in questionable Landlord Engagement fund expenditures, including $29,951 allegedly for the Director's administrative assistant</p></li><li><p>$130,109 in credit card charges plus $46,994 in reimbursements, including $1,800 at a restaurant operated by the Director's sister</p></li><li><p>$11 million in payments miscoded as "temporary services"</p></li><li><p>3,482 ledger edits totaling $8.9 million</p></li></ul><p>Beyond finances, the request documents unreported safety incidents including a fire, a stabbing, and staff injuries at Strobel House - all while operating without proper contracts. It shows 80+ housing units sitting empty for a year while encampments are cleared. Most damning: a 528% funding increase since FY2020 with virtually no improvement in housing placements.</p><p>This audit request doesn't even capture everything my reporting has uncovered - the consultant reports steering us away from collective accountability, the media restrictions in contracts, the breakdown of relationships with service providers, or the voices of unhoused residents themselves. It's merely the documented, verifiable tip of an iceberg that demands professional examination.</p><p>The full request, with 17 detailed endnotes of supporting evidence, makes clear why an independent audit isn't just warranted - it's essential.</p><p>If you read my work for reasons besides <em>making sure I’m not talking about you</em>, I think you may share some of my concerns.</p><p>Luckily, there is something you can do about it. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If, in fact, all of this is a big misunderstanding, if those of us who have been raising flags about what has been happening for years are just <em>confused</em> or are acting in <em>bad faith</em>, an internal audit is a good way to sort that out.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Ask</h3><p><strong>So I’m asking you,</strong> in the interest in us all being able to ground ourselves in a mutually agreed-upon foundation of truth, <strong>to email the Office of Internal Audit today</strong> and ask them to perform a full, unbiased, professional audit of the financial and operational processes of the Office of Homeless Services.</p><p>Below is a draft of an email that you might consider sending.</p><p>You can click this link and it will autofill an email with the relevant information. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;mailto:Lauren.Riley@nashville.gov,OIA@nashville.gov?subject=Request%20for%20OHS%20Audit%20-%20Metro%20Code%202.24.300&amp;body=Dear%20Metro%20Audit%20Committee%2C%0A%0APer%20Metropolitan%20Charter%20Section%208.121%20and%20Metro%20Code%202.24.300%2C%20I%20request%20a%20comprehensive%20audit%20of%20the%20Office%20of%20Homeless%20Services.%0A%0AHomelessness%20sits%20at%20the%20intersection%20of%20our%20most%20vulnerable%20and%20most%20powerful%20residents%2C%20making%20transparency%20essential.%0A%0APublic%20records%20reveal%20concerns%20requiring%20professional%20examination%2C%20including%20but%20not%20limited%20to%3A%0A-%20%24568%2C923%20in%20invoices%20paid%20outside%20contract%20dates%0A-%20%24565%2C577%20in%20questionable%20fund%20expenditures%0A-%20Unreported%20safety%20incidents%20at%20Metro%20facilities%0A-%20528%25%20funding%20increase%20with%20no%20improvement%20in%20outcomes%0A%0AAs%20%2450M%20in%20federal%20ARPA%20funds%20approach%20expiration%2C%20an%20independent%20audit%20of%20OHS%20finances%20and%20operations%20is%20essential%20for%20accountability%20to%20all%20stakeholders%20-%20especially%20our%20unhoused%20neighbors.%0A%0AThank%20you.%0A%0ASincerely%2C%0A%5BYour%20Name%5D&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Send Email Requesting an Internal Audit&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="mailto:Lauren.Riley@nashville.gov,OIA@nashville.gov?subject=Request%20for%20OHS%20Audit%20-%20Metro%20Code%202.24.300&amp;body=Dear%20Metro%20Audit%20Committee%2C%0A%0APer%20Metropolitan%20Charter%20Section%208.121%20and%20Metro%20Code%202.24.300%2C%20I%20request%20a%20comprehensive%20audit%20of%20the%20Office%20of%20Homeless%20Services.%0A%0AHomelessness%20sits%20at%20the%20intersection%20of%20our%20most%20vulnerable%20and%20most%20powerful%20residents%2C%20making%20transparency%20essential.%0A%0APublic%20records%20reveal%20concerns%20requiring%20professional%20examination%2C%20including%20but%20not%20limited%20to%3A%0A-%20%24568%2C923%20in%20invoices%20paid%20outside%20contract%20dates%0A-%20%24565%2C577%20in%20questionable%20fund%20expenditures%0A-%20Unreported%20safety%20incidents%20at%20Metro%20facilities%0A-%20528%25%20funding%20increase%20with%20no%20improvement%20in%20outcomes%0A%0AAs%20%2450M%20in%20federal%20ARPA%20funds%20approach%20expiration%2C%20an%20independent%20audit%20of%20OHS%20finances%20and%20operations%20is%20essential%20for%20accountability%20to%20all%20stakeholders%20-%20especially%20our%20unhoused%20neighbors.%0A%0AThank%20you.%0A%0ASincerely%2C%0A%5BYour%20Name%5D"><span>Send Email Requesting an Internal Audit</span></a></p><p><strong>A draft email to the Office of Internal Audit:</strong> </p><blockquote><p><strong>To:</strong> Lauren.Riley@nashville.gov, OIA@nashville.gov</p><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request for Comprehensive Audit of Office of Homeless Services per Metro Code 2.24.300</p><p><strong>Body:</strong> Dear Metro Audit Committee,</p><p>I am writing to request that the Office of Internal Audit exercise its authority under Metropolitan Charter Section 8.121 and Metropolitan Code Section 2.24.300 to conduct a comprehensive audit of the Office of Homeless Services.</p><p>As an independent appraisal agency established to ensure the integrity, accountability, effectiveness, and efficiency of Metro service activities, your office is uniquely positioned to examine OHS operations. The Office of Homeless Services manages critical services at the intersection of our most vulnerable residents and significant public resources, making it essential to verify these systems are functioning as intended.</p><p>Nashville invested $50 million in federal ARPA funds to address homelessness in 2022, with expenditure deadlines approaching in December 2026. Information found in contracts, public records, and court documents raises questions warranting professional examination, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li><p>$568,923 in invoices paid outside of contract dates</p></li><li><p>$565,577 in Landlord Engagement fund expenditures requiring review</p></li><li><p>Safety incidents at Metro facilities that may not have been properly reported</p></li><li><p>$2 million in temporary ARPA funds allocated to permanent positions</p></li><li><p>A 528% funding increase since FY2020 without corresponding increases in housing placements</p></li></ul><p>Per your mandate to conduct financial audits, performance audits, and investigations of any Metro department, a comprehensive review of both OHS's financial management and operational effectiveness would provide the clarity needed to understand what is happening with these critical resources. Whether to confirm proper functioning or identify areas for improvement, an independent audit would establish a foundation of verified facts.</p><p>As this once-in-a-lifetime federal investment approaches its expiration, transparency through professional audit is essential for all stakeholders - most importantly, our unhoused neighbors who depend on these services.</p><p>Thank you for your consideration of this audit request.</p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>[Your Name]</p></blockquote><p></p>
