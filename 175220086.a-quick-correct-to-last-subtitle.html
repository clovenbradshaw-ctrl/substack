<p>Often a title and subtitle are the last to be written and therefore most likely to have an error. The article from the AM had a subtitle that said <em>“Oracle left CA for TX in 2020. Now they’re coming to Nashville. But only after TN changed its law to allow data processors like Oracle to give data to law enforcement with a warrant.”</em> But it should have said <strong>“</strong><em><strong>without a warrant”</strong>. </em>That’s the thing that makes it noteworthy.<br></p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;826be3c7-780c-4f8c-aea4-7ffb856e912d&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The TechnoFutilist Doctrine Comes to Tennessee&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What exactly does Oracle want to do in Nashville?

Notice anything else that needs fixing? Just reply to this email.</p><p>But while we’re here, I was asked a question since publishing:</p><p><em>What is TechnoFutilism?</em></p><p>That is what I want to get into once the table has been set with Larry Ellison of Oracle, more as a character to unpack than a current event figure to contend with. But I don’t want to be needlessly obscure.</p><p>TechnoFutilism is a term I’ve invented for all all pervasive vibe that has overtaken the world, flowing from the top down. </p><p>It has similarities to industrialist totalitarianism of last century, the ambition in both Communist countries and the Imperial West. This vibe took its footing in the advancement of science and rationalism that had built the industrial, mechanized world, railroads, warships, skyscrapers. It had learned that with enough brute force, chemistry and determination, order could be imposed on the world, what once took months could now take hours, skylines that stopped at five stories of brick had a hundred stories of glass and steel. This same architectural design approach was, naturally enough, applied to society, with basic systems of inputs and outputs the model for how to make follow a logical pattern. </p><p>There were two different strategies for imposing order: in the Soviet East, needs of the people and their lots in life was pre-calculated, scheduled out in things like <em>five year plans</em>. In the Democratic West, the hands of the free market was installed as the emergent engine of change, lettings people’s fortune and stations rise and fall, and needs go met or disregarded, all dictated by the <em>animal spirits of capitalism.</em> </p><p>In sociopolitical terms, both of these frameworks were <em>modern</em>. And like modern art, they were imbued with a sincere belief in their objective, universally applicable power to create the world it’s constituents wanted to see.</p><p>TechnoFutilism is what happens in the West <em>after that.</em> After we’ve seen the limits of the free market. After we see that <em>everyone looking out for themselves</em> does not build a utopia, not even for the 1%. Where once the architects of society had quiet literally been architects, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses">Robert Moses</a>(es) of the world, no the world is designed by software developers and consultants. Their logic, that of data tables, relational databases, social graph networks, and Key Performance Indicators is shaping our fate.</p><p>But this time the totalitarian world view of this value-meme and its priestly class, the tech titans and their priestly class of McKinsey consultants and Bloomberg Foundation courtiers, do not have a <em>modernist </em>aesthetic to their thinking.</p><p>There is a doomed, fatalistic logic inside of the quest to control everything through data and optimization. There is a <em>post-modern</em> self awareness that their sole guiding principle is a doomed ambition, bound to cause more harm than good as it tries to order the world and its oddly shaped pieces into neatly structured rows in columns in a single unified database.</p><p>Databases, even ones meant to mimic the complexity of real interactions like network graphs, rely on things called <em>schemas.</em> These are predetermined frameworks of how things relate to each other. It is the logic of “this record connect to that record in this way” with dynamics preset before the data is loaded in.</p><p>Some more advanced systems like graph databased (provided by companies like Oracle) claim they are <em>schema-less, </em>that they can accept all information in the world raw, perfectly mirroring its deep complexity. But this lack of schema is an illusion, you still need to create a framework, a <em>schema</em>, to learn anything from this data — you have to impose meaning on the outside, meaning you’re predetermining what you find before you look for it.</p><p>TechnoFutilism is the dark, somber, existentially unsettled psychology at the core of our technocratic self-declared god emperors who know, perhaps more than any leaders before them, that their life’s ambition to overcome the limitations of life itself is futile. But they cannot conceive of anything else to do with life than to try, in vain, to overcome the limitations life itself.</p><p>It’s not a coincidence that our rulers, from Ellison and Altman pursuing anti-aging, or Putin and Xi fixating on organ transplants, are all obsessed with ending morality.</p><p><strong>Business Insider: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-trying-to-hack-longevity-and-live-forever-2025-9">The tech billionaires trying to hack aging to extend their lives</a></strong><br>BBC: <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1w9z72r6o">Organ transplants for immortality: Might Xi and Putin be onto something?</a></strong></p><p>It nothing new for the powerful to want to avoid death, seeking out shaman and holy grails. But there is something decidedly nihilistic and self-aware about how these figures are pursuing it, and how they are shaping our entire world around these very anxieties. </p><p>Here is an except from Larry Ellison’s authorized biography, which I will heavily cite in my next piece.</p><blockquote><p><em>“If you want to understand why people do things, then take a course in evolutionary psychology. What we want to do with our lives is the most important question we all have to answer. So if I could do anything at all with my life, what would I do? I’d cure cancer.⁹ I’d much rather cure cancer than become the richest guy in the world. Why? Because I’d be a much happier person if I cured cancer. Why? Because I’d be loved. Why? Because people don’t want to suffer painful death. Why? You know why.”</em></p><p><em>⁹ Yes, I know that cancer is a collection of diseases and it is very unlikely that there will ever be a single cure. Still, my mother died of cancer and I want to cure cancer. That’s where most of my money and all of my time after Oracle are likely to go.</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s not to say that spending billions on anti-cancer research is not a bad ambition. But the TechnoFutilist is at the cusp of a spiritual cliff, and must choose whether they have the faith to walk off the ledge or not.</p><p>This leap of faith has to do with the core of <em>why we are all here.</em> </p><p>In the Platonic dialogue <em>Phaedo</em>, Socrates faces his execution day, having been sentenced to death on charges of corrupting the youth and impiety. The political context: although Socrates himself refused to cooperate with the Thirty Tyrants who briefly overthrew Athens’ democracy, some of his former students (notably Critias) had been among these oligarchs. The restored democracy, bound by an amnesty preventing direct prosecution for oligarchic associations, instead prosecuted him on religious and moral grounds.</p><p>In the <em>Phaedo</em>, rather than discussing law or politics, Socrates spends his final hours arguing for the immortality of the soul and explaining why philosophers should view death as the liberation of the soul from the body.</p><p>Plato reports that he told them:<br><br><em>Κινδυνεύουσι γὰρ ὅσοι τυγχάνουσιν ὀρθῶς ἁπτόμενοι φιλοσοφίας λεληθέναι τοὺς ἄλλους ὅτι οὐδὲν ἄλλο αὐτοὶ ἐπιτηδεύουσιν ἢ ἀποθνῄσκειν τε καὶ τεθνάναι.</em></p><p>“Those who engage with philosophy in the right way have gone unnoticed by others in this: they pursue nothing else but the practice of dying and being dead.”</p><p>Our world is in the hands of TechnoFutilist oligarchs whose drive is to overcome the limits of mortality. </p><p>What better place to develop a new philosophy that can move us beyond fixation, and build a way of seeing the world that can account for the <em>schema overflow</em> that is reality,<em> </em>than in Nashville, <em>The Athens of the South.</em></p>
