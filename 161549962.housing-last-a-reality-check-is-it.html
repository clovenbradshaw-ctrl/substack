want to redesign them after many more of us come in contact with it — let’s have a reality check. </p><p><strong>Have I been overhyping the crisis we are facing because of cuts across the entire federal government?</strong> </p><p>A Q&amp;A held this morning between Mayor Freddie O’Connell tells me: no. I’m not overselling the danger of the coming flood. </p><p>Earlier today, Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, spoke on Microsoft Teams to a coalition of homelessness advocates, and delivered a candid assessment of Nashville’s response to homelessness. </p><p>His comments resonate with Rep. Aftyn Behn’s admonition to all Tennesseans: “<a href="https://aftynbehnfortn.substack.com/p/black-women-deserve-better-than-a?r=2112f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED.”</a></p><p>O’Connell’s remarks zeroed in on <strong>severe budget cuts</strong>, <strong>federal policy shifts</strong>, and the increasingly fragile web of services available to the unhoused.</p><p>Local service providers had submitted questions, and advocates and some members of the unhoused community themselves raised alarm about the fallout from funding disruptions and the lack of safe, legal alternatives for people experiencing homelessness.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Key Quotes from Mayor O’Connell</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>On cascading job losses and service erosion:<br></strong>“We’re not just seeing cuts in services at this point. We’re seeing active job loss of local public employees.”</p></li><li><p><strong>On collapsed capacity to deploy emergency shelters:<br></strong>“The cuts to the Metro public health department included epidemiological lab capacity, community health worker and COVID cuts that actually cut the staffing… linked to delivery of the pallet shelters.”</p></li><li><p><strong>On a federal policy shift that threatens local strategy:<br></strong>“The Trump administration and HUD in this model seem to be making very vocal shifts away from Housing First as a federal approach to how we deliver local homelessness response...”</p></li><li><p><strong>On the unconstitutional ending of services that are congressionally provisioned:</strong></p><p>When we see things that we think are just obviously unconstitutional at either the state or federal level, we are going to be protecting Nashville's constitutional rights… continue to share with us if you see something that is absolutely unlawful or unconstitutional—we want to know about it.</p></li><li><p><strong>On the existential strain facing Nashville’s budget:<br></strong>“Unfortunately, I think a lot of this year's budget is going to directly confront us all with questions of prioritization… having to play defense against deeper cuts...”</p></li><li><p><strong>On sanctioned encampments and institutional consensus:<br></strong>“If we can’t create a landscape where we’re creating housing or shelter fast enough in a structured way—is it better to just offer the land?… It's not been a consensus perspective of either the Homelessness Planning Council or providers for a while.

During his remarks, he noted that:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Critical services</strong> affected by funding disruptions include:</p><ul><li><p>Section 8 housing</p></li><li><p>Shelter Plus Care</p></li><li><p>CDBG funding</p></li><li><p>Mobile housing navigation (e.g., through the Salvation Army)</p></li><li><p>The Connector Card transit program</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Jeff Swafford of Nashville Street Project raised concerns about these losses. O’Connell responded by affirming their severity:</p><blockquote><p>“One of the most difficult scenarios we dealt with over the past few weeks was that sudden loss of funding at the Metro public health department, which very frustratingly and sadly cost us five jobs for Metro employees.”​</p></blockquote><p>He added that Metro has already filed <strong>one lawsuit</strong> and is exploring others regarding <strong>federal funding obligations that were authorized but undelivered</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>“For some of the infrastructure funding that was already congressionally authorized... we have engaged in one lawsuit already, and we are exploring other lawsuits...”​</p></blockquote><p>Private institutions like <strong>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</strong> are also implementing large-scale cuts:</p><blockquote><p>“Vanderbilt University Medical Center... has already announced that they are reducing their budget this year by $250 million... that's also going to mean job loss.”​</p></blockquote><p>He specifically cited losses to <strong>COVID-era programs</strong>, including:</p><blockquote><p>“Cuts to the Metro public health department included epidemiological lab capacity, community health worker and COVID cuts that actually cut the staffing... linked to delivery of the pallet shelters.”​</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Federal Shift Away from Housing First</strong></h2><p>The mayor warned of a <strong>federal policy shift</strong> away from the widely accepted Housing First model:</p><blockquote><p>“The Trump administration and HUD in this model seem to be making very vocal shifts away from Housing First as a federal approach to how we deliver local homelessness response...”​</p></blockquote><p>This pivot, he suggested, complicates <strong>local strategy and funding alignment</strong>, especially for <strong>permanent supportive housing</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Budget Strategy: Defensive, Not Expansive</strong></h2><p>Responding to HG Stovall of Launchpad, Mayor O’Connell acknowledged that despite successful mobile outreach models, Metro is unlikely to sustain them without new funds:</p><blockquote><p>“Mobile housing navigation process has, I think, been one of our success stories... but... this year's budget is going to directly confront us all with questions of prioritization...”​</p></blockquote><p>He added:</p><blockquote><p>“We're going to... have to play defense against deeper cuts and figuring out how we're going to mitigate.”​</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2><strong>No Dedicated Local Revenue, No Backfill Capacity</strong></h2><p>On comparisons to Austin’s dedicated homelessness funding, O’Connell was candid:</p><blockquote><p>“Right now we do not have a fully dedicated funding scenario available for how we're doing revenues.”​</p></blockquote><p>He explained that <strong>Tennessee state law limits options</strong> for local revenue generation, but Metro is exploring:</p><ul><li><p>Voluntary developer incentives</p></li><li><p>Litigation for withheld federal funds</p></li><li><p>Engagement with philanthropic partners​</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Encampment Dilemma: “Nowhere to Go”</strong></h2><p>Lindsey Krinks of Open Table Nashville relayed a question from Old Tent City residents: <strong>With fewer shelter beds than unhoused persons, where can people go if not outdoors? Could a piece of land be dedicated for people to live?</strong> O’Connell answered:</p><blockquote><p>“This is still one of the most difficult questions that probably any community faces, is the one about where people go when there just simply is not enough housing, including in the shelter space, right?”​</p></blockquote><p>He expressed concerns about sanctioned encampments, citing:</p><blockquote><p>“True safety concerns that involve everything from the trains moving through the area, that involve electricity, kind of being ad hoc... that involve human trafficking...”​</p></blockquote><p>He reiterated:</p><blockquote><p>“I'm still not... persuaded that just the city saying, Hey, here's some land, anybody can go there is, is the right approach.… It's not been a consensus perspective of either the Homelessness Planning Council or providers for a while. So I think this is one that's going to be an ongoing conversation.”​</p></blockquote><p>Still, he says he remains open to further discussion with advocates and mutual aid groups.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>New Legislation, New Risks</strong></h2><p>Regarding a <strong>new Tennessee law</strong> that enables encampment clearances by TDOT upon citizen request—with no guarantee of housing or services—O’Connell said:</p><blockquote><p>“It was pretty clear that when this bill got filed it was very likely to pass despite our efforts...”​</p></blockquote><p>He acknowledged that Metro is still <strong>figuring out how to notify providers in time</strong> so they can intervene before TDOT enforcement:</p><blockquote><p>“We're still working with... Darren Jernigan... engaged to do what we could.”​</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3>O’Connell’s remarks painted a clear picture.</h3><p><strong>Federal support is weakening</strong>, <strong>state policy is becoming more punitive</strong>, and <strong>local resources are insufficient</strong> to meet a rising need.</p><p>There is as yet no clear Plan B. No millions of dollars hidden in government couch cushions. </p><div><hr></div><h2>Action Steps</h2><p>Want to do something about it?</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/council/council-districts">Look up your Metro Council Member</a> and tell them what you want to see in the 2026 Metro Nashville Budget.</p></li><li><p>Attend your closest <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/planning/long-range-planning/neighborhoods/neighborhood-links">Neighborhood Association Meeting</a> and connect with like-minded residents.
