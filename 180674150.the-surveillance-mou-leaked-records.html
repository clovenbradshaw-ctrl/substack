<p>STATE OF TENNESSEE RECORDS<br>obtained yesterday further complicate the narrative put forth by the Nashville Mayor’s Office and The Nashville Downtown Partnership (NDP) around the so called “Thanksgiving MOU”. </p><p>The documents show that contrary to repeated statements, emails, and flyers printed by the Nashville Mayor’s Office in support of its push for RS2025-1659, the Nashville Downtown Partnership has not been awarded $15M by the State of Tennessee.</p><p>The assertion was used as part of a defensive vote whipping campaign to convince the Metro Council that it was in their constituents best interest to sign on for the resolution that was submitted without notice before a holiday break. </p><p>The administration’s argument was consistent: The Nashville Downtown Partnership was already awarded these funds, and this MOU would be Metro’s only ability to control how they are used.</p><p>Documents obtained last night reveal that this is false.</p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substack.com/img/attachment_icon.svg"></image><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">Ndmc Grant</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">236KB ∙ PDF file</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/api/v1/file/7faa66b1-c82f-4cee-b625-ec844f199db7.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/api/v1/file/7faa66b1-c82f-4cee-b625-ec844f199db7.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div><p>An official communication from Jennifer Brinkman, Director Office of Criminal Justice Programs for the State of Tennessee, states plainly that the District Management Corporation (DMC), not the Nashville Downtown Partnership, was awarded the $15M by the State of Tennessee.

into account that as a quasi governmental 501(c)(3), the DMC’s yearly budget is subject to review and approval by the legislative body. This would offer a direct democratic check on public safety expenditures far more effectively than the proposed MOU that would entitle NDP to the funds.</p><p>The Downtown Partnership, a 501(c)(6) with a tumultuous track record that has been splashed across recent headlines, would have no such public control over what it buys and how it spends its money beyond the sparse terms of the MOU that the Mayor’s Office submitted to Council. It would appear that transferring the grant funding to NDP would severely limit the oversight the Metro Council could exert over these funds.</p><p>Why the administration so adamantly misrepresented who the actual recipient of this grant allocation is likely to be the subject of another prosecutorial round of Metro Council meetings when the resolution is up for a vote on Dec 16.</p><p>The move to place funding for controversial public safety expenditures in nonprofits outside the reach of democratic controls aligns with national trends the surveillance researcher Ed Vogel and I <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/a-nashville-proposal-could-outsource-surveillance-and-policing-to-a-nonprofit/">reported on in the outlet Truthout this week </a></p><div><hr></div><p><em>Context</em></p><p>This is the resolution that spawned an email from Mayor O’Connell’s Legislative Affairs Director Dave Rosenberg denouncing “misinformation” being post online about it.</p><blockquote><p>This resolution has been the subject of a significant amount of misinformation. NDP has been awarded a state grant of $15 million and expects to receive the money from the state by the end of December.</p><p><em>Dave Rosenberg, November 26, 2025</em></p></blockquote><p>In these two sentences Rosenberg is putting forth two key points that the Mayor’s Office has been very consistent on. </p><ol><li><p>People are spreading untruths about this legislation.</p></li><li><p>“The state has already awarded the Nashville Downtown Partnership $15 million for downtown public safety.”</p></li></ol><p>They even went the extra mile to print out these lovely flyers and distributed

revealed an extraordinary arrangement: Metro Nashville would explicitly decline $15 million in state public safety funds and allow Nashville Downtown Partnership—a private nonprofit—to apply instead. </p><p>It also detailed several proposed purchases of tools that <a href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/p/new-surveillance-tech-requires-a">appear to meet the criteria of “surveillance technology</a>  as defined by an ordinance drafted by former Council Member Dave Rosenberg.</p><p>Despite this being the plain language of the resolution, it has been framed by the administration as an attempt to “limit” the NDP from buying things they believes would be problematic. In Mr. Rosenberg’s repudiation of “misinformation” to Council last week he wrote: </p><blockquote><p>Under this MOU, NDP agrees to limit the uses of the funds to a finite list, all of which are already permitted by Metro. (Absent the MOU, NDP has the option to apply the funds to a wider list of uses, though they’ve stated they will not do so.)</p></blockquote><p>The resolution and attached MOU was the subject of uncompromising questions by Nashville’s Council Members on both the Public Health and Safety and the Budget and Finance Committees on Wednesday. A repeated question put to the administration was: <strong>is it correct that the Nashville Downtown Partnership is getting this money even if this MOU is not approved?</strong></p><p>Again and again, Dave Rosenberg, Mayor O’Connell’s Director of Legislative Affairs, provided different versions of the response “the Downtown Partnership is getting these funds with or without this MOU.” Yet he hedged his comments multiple times with the deflection “I am not a lawyer” and he equivocated his statements with conditionals such as “from what I’ve been told.”</p><p>In the Public Health and Safety Committee, CM Sean Parker broke down in simple terms what the grant solicitation requires, and how the MOU he was being asked to vote for looked very much like one of the documents described in its requirements. This, he seemed to think, was odd, since he was being told that the grant was “already awarded.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png" width="1456" height="820" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4368270,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/i/180674150?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XWBp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb43fffde-5421-4c1c-aecd-c8e382da0b27_2850x1606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“My read was that this MOU,” Parker noted, “is the thing that satisfies those two grant requirements.

gone out of their way to portray this MOU the way that they have. </p><p>There will likely be a “well, actually” that “since these two orgs are so closely connected, we were using the term interchangeably.” Or that “we are <em>technically</em> telling the truth because the DMC will probably give the NDP the money anyway.”</p><p>This is not what they said. What the administration and NDP officials said over and over and printed flyers to correct “misinformation” is, and I quote, “NDP has been awarded a state grant of $15 million.”</p><p>And the deeper question beneath it is: “Why don’t they just let the money go to the Nashville District Management Corporation (DMC)?”</p><p>One thing does seem true, the state <em>has</em> awarded the funds to an organization in Nashville. And if these public safety funds are going to flow into Nashville, and since the Mayor’s Office unilaterally decided for the city not to apply, the DMC isn’t the worst option.</p><p>The DMC has many benefits. </p><p>It is a quasi governmental entity that, we’ve recently learned, is subject to Metro Council oversight of its budget. This arrangement would actually help make sure that public safety funds were being used in ways that are in the best interest of all Nashvillians. This leverage over the DMC’s budget could help make sure they stay in alignment with things like the 2017 surveillance ordinance written by Fmr. Council Member Dave Rosenberg. </p><p>Why would the Mayor’s Office be going out of its way to redirect those funds into a 3rd party non-profit that is not subject to things like 4th Amendment regulations and democratic oversight on its expenditures? Why would it prefer to put these funds into a non-profit that the Mayor’s Office is attempting to contractually obligate to purchase surveillance technology such as <a
