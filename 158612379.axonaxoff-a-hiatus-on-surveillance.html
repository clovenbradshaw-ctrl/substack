<p>In Fusus News, the O'Connell administration did not file paperwork as required to hold a vote on March 18 on the potential contract with Axon for a distributed surveillance system called Fusus. The expectation amongst many was that it the resolution would be submitted for next Council meeting, along with the 3rd and final reading of the ordinances that would restrict how MNPD could use the tool.<br><br>It's not an indication that it won't return in the future, but it is a relief for those what oppose the system outright — and for the increasing number of Council Members who have unanswered questions about how exactly the system would protect Nashvillans’ privacy.<br><br>I had sent a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11cizDNwfmH95i0qh2IZEo197ZATigOS5-MlWhEzhSZQ/edit?usp=sharing">list of questions</a> to Metro Officals as well as Axon execs, with all member of Council CC'd, to try to get answers from those who were driving the bill towards passage. A handful of Council Members reached out to me, offering to try to accelerate the responses and/or to discuss their own, new or preexisting concerns about these topics. <br><br>36 hours after submitting the request for answers to these operational questions about Fusus and the Axon corporations’ policies and practices, we still have not received a response or a confirmation of receipt from any of the addresses.</p><p>I wasn’t butt hurt that they didn’t respond to my email. I do not, as my girlfriend likes to remind me while I’m out here doing weird stuff like <a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/p/axons-fusus-is-a-bad-idea-just-ask">pulling up the mayor’s Twitter receipts</a>, “have any power.” And by that, she means I don’t write for an outlet or work for any agency of influence, I’m just a guy <em>saying stuff</em> — so it’s not in any way weird that very busy government officials and corporate executives didn’t take time to respond to my highly detailed questions and the minutia of contract law.</p><p>Not responding to a private citizen’s questions about intellectual property ownership policies and data sharing for federal agencies within 36 hours is in no way <em>problematic. </em>But not even acknowledging receipt of the questions on an email chain with all 40 members of the City Council copied?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

city at large. Though there’s little consensus about what exactly <em>is</em> being communicated.<br>I personally hope Mayor O'Connell comments that he has heard the concerns of community members, and that while we can all agree we want to be safer, it won't be through using tools like Fusus (or partners like Axon) that make many people in the Trump 2.0 era feel even less safe than today.<br><br>He still has a campaign pledge for a Community Safety plan in his back pocket, and community groups and elected officials I’ve spoken to are eager to start at the place where we really are: getting on the same page about what “safety” <em>means</em> to us. And what to do when we have different definitions?</p><p>When working in the Office of Community Safety, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UaUyWSQ4vQV2Pi-sroTNdhdIq-lTfheV77uilnJuD68/edit?usp=sharing">I did some work</a> to refine the conceptual differences between “Community Safety” and “Public Safety.” I wasn’t inventing this from whole cloth, rather, I was synthesizing what I was seeing in literature that hadn’t quite been fully articulated.</p><p>Without much to rail about right now, let’s take a breather and think about some of the tensions that have emerged thus far in this feud. Mayor O’Connell has found himself in the seemingly intractible tension between Public Safety advocates and Community Safety advocates. There’s a lot of money to be made by corporations like Axon to firmly choose a side in this, and a lot of self righteousness and dang ass memes to be made in ignoring the necessity, and inherent limits, of both of these perspectives. </p><p>And it’s the role of leaders to learn the cognitive and emotional skills needed to genuinely integrate these perspectives within themselves so that they can help manifest them in their city. It’s for those interested in creating lasting change, not just on the material level, but that vague psychosocial <em>spiritual</em> plane that those of us who lean non-theistic have a hard time articulating and believing in.</p><h3>Here’s the Game Being Played Out</h3><p>Here, and across the country.

worldview that is fixated on firm concepts like “offenders” and “victims” and protecting <em>the innocent</em> while punishing the <em>the guilty.</em> It is directly linked to the self-emerging concept that shows up around the world called “The Rule of Law.” </p><p>Before we get into how this is problematic (the part of the conversation my Leftist sisters and brothers want to skip right into), this is a <strong>vital and necessary</strong> emergent capacity of human society and there cannot be large scale peaceful society without developing this capacity. The problem comes when we do not transcend and include the limits of this capacity.</p><p>I won’t go into my full Hegelian Developmental Sociology lens on what’s happening there, but basically, Public Safety institutions and frankly <em>vibes</em> we see in society develop and maintain are fueled by the fear that without these vibes, we will descend into uncivilized chaos. The term “Thin Blue Line” is literally a reference to the belief that law enforcement is the only “barrier between law and order and social and civil anarchy.”</p><p>While I again have to warn my friends that are die hard ACAB that we’ll get to the problems with the victim vs offender paradigm, human groups that have not developed this capacity are very — unchill. You empirically see things like charismatic leaders taking systemic advantage of people in brutal, extremely dehumanizing ways. The stage that exists before the Public Safety stage is what we see in drug cartels, organized crime, warlords, and abusive sex cults. </p><p>This type of social operating system is <em>explicitly</em> what is <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/trump-supporters-violence-2658499670/?utm_source=smartnews">being called for</a> by proponents of turning the American Presidency into a Caesar-like dictatorship and to overturn the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/extreme-legal-theory-behind-trumps-first-month-office">Rule of Law</a>. Something that I’d put pretty firmly into the category of “been there, done that… let’s not.”</p><p>The emergence of “the rule of law” in human groups puts <em>no one</em> above the agreed-upon norms of “civilized” society. Anyone, even the king, is eligible to shift into the category of “perpetrator,” and anyone as lowly as a peasant could be considered an “innocent victim.” This is the juice behind <em>The Magna Carta</em>, and the psychosocial dynamics manifested through it were much more important for the development of Western society than the specific contents of its laws.</p><p>Public safety is built upon the dialectical tension between “victims” and “perpetrators.” When left to its own devices, the logic of Public Safety becomes fixated on “completely innocent victims” and “irridimable perpetrators.” The “Public” whose safety “Public Safety” is focused on quickly gets conflated with the idea of “totally innocent victims,” and those outsiders that we fear may harm them, for a variety of biases and prejudices, get lumped together “perpetrators” that must be monitored and controlled at any cost.</p><p>And it’s from the limitations of Public Safety that Community Safety emerges. </p><p><strong>Community Safety </strong>is more often about providing the framework and infrastructure for areas and demographics that are most often disenfranchised by the majority population out of almost unfounded anxiety that they are potential perpetrators that may harm them. The lack of resources that these populations have, and virtually <em>nothing else</em> research shows, is the primary reason there appears to be more violence in disenfranchised communities. It is also a matter of how we define <em>violence.</em> Notably, lower income communities in America have the lowest rates of members committing crimes  like insider trading, corporate tax evasion, securities fraud, illegal denial of insurance claims, and other forms of “white collar” non-violent crime. </p><p>Social workers, teachers, mentors, youth group leaders, community health workers, violence interrupters - these are the roles that come up when we usually talk about Community Safety. It’s not that these jobs don’t exist inside communities that talk primarily about Public Safety, in fact they often exist with a surplus. The very fact that they have bountiful resources for these things mean they <em>don’t have to </em>fixate on them.</p><p>Those focused on Community Safety are usually fixated on the conditions needed to protect marginalized groups from harm, harm coming from a lack of resources that allow for the healthy development and flourishing of humans in a nourishing environment, and from the excesses of “Public Safety” institutions fulling their reason for being by looking for groups to identify as “perpetrators.” </p><p>The Public Safety and Rule of Law capacities are not the cognitive frameworks where racism and prejudice <em>first</em> emerge in human groups. But Public Safety programs (as Community Safety advocates get blue in the face explaining over and over and suffer compassion fatigue fighting against) very often exploit pre-existing prejudices to justify labelling whole <em>types of people as </em>perpetrators, or at least as potential ones. And this plays into conscious or unconscious justifications by Public Safety-focused groups in limiting resources for those groups, which creates a vicious feedback loop where people with few options and emotional and social developmental disadvantages resort to providing for themselves by any means necessary, and that inevitably sometime means violence.</p><p>And the great irony of course is that without being allowed the resources and social cohesion to allow things like Rule of Law to flourish, and with Public Safety agencies <em>not</em> demonstrating genine rule of law principles on them, with police demonstrably <em>not</em> treating everyone equally under the law — the Public Safety agenda creates pockets in society where the very thing its dead set against, society backsliding into “social and civil anarchy”.
