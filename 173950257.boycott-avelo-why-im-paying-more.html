Today, a press release goes out announcing the first protest, taking place near BNA’s cell phone waiting lot Saturday morning.</p><p>If you’ve read my stuff, you know I’m not a reactionary. I think a lot about what I say and support. I don’t endorse things lightly. If you’re a conservative reader, I especially would like you to hear my reasons for supporting this — because it might not be what you think.</p><p>I support using my dollars to signal what values I want to see in my country. And the values that I see missing in our immigration space are <strong>LAW</strong> and <strong>ORDER</strong>. I know it sounds ironic to say I’m boycotting an airline who works with ICE because I support Law and Order, but stick with me. </p><p>Law and Order requires <em>all of us</em> to follow the law. <em>You</em> may have strong feelings about people entering our borders without proper paperwork. <em>I</em> have strong feelings about people enforcing our laws while breaking them. These aren’t opposing values, they are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>Here’s the thing: I’m not a member of the DSA. I’ve really enjoyed organizing with them, and if there was a type of society I’d like to see, it would be <em>well-implemented </em>Socialism<em> </em>(heavy emphasis on the <em>well-implemented</em>). But in a broader way, I feel more aligned with <a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism-the-conquest-of-a-term/">Metamodernism</a>, and I think I makes some Democratic Socialists a little wary because of my alignments in that realm. These are days for strange bed fellows. People have reached out to me recently who never thought they’d see eye-to-eye with a Leftist, and I too have had the scales drop from my eyes on many occasions lately.</p><p>When I say “Metamodernism”, here are a few articles from a friend of mine to give you a sense of what I mean by that. To put it simply, it’s about squaring all the parts of ourselves that the world wants to tell us are irreconcilable, tensions that powerful people profit off of in ways we all complain about but can’t seem to solve. Metamoderism is an approach that says “if you can find how these tensions can be synthesized in yourself, it will help you unlock these tensions in the world.”</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism-more-conservative-than-conservatism/">Metamodernism, More Conservative than Conservatism</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism-more-liberal-than-liberalism/">Metamodernism, More Liberal than Liberalism</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism-more-egalitarian-than-socialism/">Metamodernism, More Egalitarian than Socialism</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism-more-sustainable-than-ecologism/">Metamodernism, More Sustainable than Ecologism</a></strong></p></li></ul><p>I am not flippant about violence around immigration.</p><p>Cartel violence and immigration are personal to me. My family has twice lived in Mexico, and we saw the city we lived in overtaken by their violence. There was automatic gunfire in my little sister’s carpool lane, bullets ripped into the cars of waiting mothers. We also saw what high level government corruption looked like. When I was a young child, we lived next door to family connected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Donaldo_Colosio_Murrieta">to an infamous political assassination</a>.</p><p>Ruthless gang violence and unchecked political corruption involving top government officials are two sides of the same coin. These are things that happen when you don't have the rule of law. <strong>Everyone must be accountable.</strong></p><p>This stuff isn’t theoretical to me. My family has seen first hand what a country looks like where there is no rule of law, and we—<em>you and I—</em>can’t let that happen here.</p><p>I know from my previous work in Community Safety that law enforcement has very detailed information on the members of our society who pose the most risk to all of us. All the funding we’ve flooded local law enforcement agencies with to perform surveillance hasn’t gone nowhere. If ICE’s intent was to have surgical removals of the violent cartel members wreaking havoc in America, they could do that. And in my experience, the people who would welcome that the most are <em>immigrant communities</em> because they are the most impacted by their violence (even here in America). But that’s not what ICE is doing.</p><p>Here’s just a sampling of what I’m talking about when I say ICE is eroding Law and Order, and I’m not even including what’s happened here in Nashville.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Constitutional Violations in Raids</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/us/georgia-plant-ice-raid-hundreds-arrested-hnk">ICE arrested 475 people at Hyundai plant despite having warrant for only 4 specific individuals</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/11/nx-s1-5462618/federal-judge-orders-stop-to-indiscriminate-immigration-raids-in-los-angeles">Federal judge orders stop to ICE's "roving patrols" that detained people solely based on race and speaking Spanish</a></p><p>• <a href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/la-immigration-raids-lawsuit/">ICE conducted "brazen, midday kidnappings" with warrantless entries and no reasonable suspicion</a></p><p><strong>Direct Defiance of Court Orders</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/05/30/another-ice-deportation-in-defiance-of-court-order/">ICE deported Jordin Melgar-Salmeron just 28 minutes after federal appeals court granted him permission to remain in the U.S.</a></p><p>• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia">ICE deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order specifically prohibiting his removal</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/ice-agent-contempt-boston-trial-arrest/">ICE agent arrested defendant Wilson Martell-Lebron during his active criminal trial, removing him from the courtroom</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigration-court-order-ice-targeting-people-race-not-enforced-why-rcna227792">Federal judge found ICE continued racial profiling raids in Los Angeles despite court order prohibiting the practice</a></p><p><strong>Wrongful Detention of U.S. Citizens</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.maldef.org/2025/07/maldef-takes-a-step-toward-civil-rights-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-u-s-citizen-detained-by-ice/">ICE detained U.S. citizen photographer Job Garcia for 24 hours simply for documenting a public raid</a></p><p>• <a href="https://goldman.house.gov/media/press-releases/goldman-warren-padilla-kelly-and-correa-demand-investigations-ices-detention">50 members of Congress demanded investigation after ICE detained U.S. citizen toddler and military veteran</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/09/ice-us-citizens-detention-racial-profiling">ICE systematically detained Latino U.S. citizens based on racial profiling</a></p><p><strong>Inhumane Detention Conditions Violating Federal Law</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/district-court-grants-order-prohibiting-ice-from-detaining-immigrants-in-abusive-conditions-at-26-federal-plaza">Federal judge issues emergency order after ICE held 200+ people in facility designed for 22 at 26 Federal Plaza</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/sep/16/60-violations-in-50-days-inside-ices-giant-tent-fa/">ICE's Fort Bliss facility violated 60+ federal detention standards in first 50 days of operation</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/07/21/you-feel-like-your-life-is-over/abusive-practices-at-three-florida-immigration">Five deaths in Florida ICE facilities attributed to medical neglect, including denial of HIV medication for 13 days</a></p><p><strong>Violations at Protected Locations</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/15/family-separation-26-federal-plaza-ice-ps-89/">ICE arrested 6-year-old NYC student from P.S. 89 during routine check-in</a></p><p>• <a href="https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2025/07/ice-targets-immigrants-church-grounds/">ICE conducted arrests on church grounds despite court injunction protecting places of worship</a></p><p>• <a href="https://immigrantjustice.org/press-release/unlawful-ice-arrests-at-immigration-courthouses-prompt-lawsuit-by-advocates-and-immigrants/">ICE systematically arrested people leaving immigration court hearings, undermining due process</a></p><p><strong>Retaliation for First Amendment Activity</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://prospect.org/justice/2025-09-09-dhs-claims-videotaping-ice-raids-is-violence/">DHS claims that videotaping ICE raids constitutes "violence," detained journalist for documenting public operations</a></p><p><strong>Congressional Findings</strong></p><p>• <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ossoff-report-ice-subjects-women-excessive-gynecological-procedures-1759870">Senator Ossoff documented 500+ human rights violations in ICE facilities;

They are, consistently, operating outside the bounds of due process, the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 14th amendments, and the existing federal policies for “immigration enforcement.” </p><h4><strong>And when a corporation is profiting off of that, the ethical, patriotic, and even </strong><em><strong>capitalist</strong></em><strong> thing to do is to take my business elsewhere.</strong></h4><p>Let’s be clear.</p><p>No administration has handled deportations right—not Trump, not Biden, not Obama, not any of them going back decades.</p><p>We need immigration reform that’s effective, that creates a sensical path to citizenship, that allows people to flee from violence, and that allows our economy to grow leveraging their labor without exploiting it. And to do this, we have to have  the rule of law. Period.</p><p>Tearing apart families fleeing cartel violence doesn't protect anyone. Many of these families are seeking asylum—the same chance at a better life our ancestors got. My ancestor came to Jamestown in 1640. He didn’t have papers. But we are not making our country safer by violating every fabric of our constitution ripping apart families, churches, and small businesses. </p><p>You know this. I know this.</p><p>Few people openly support <em>that side</em> of it. People say to me: “I mean I don’t want them doing that stuff, I just want them getting the gangs off the streets.” Word. <em>But that’s not what they’re focusing on</em>, and let’s keep it real. They’re not doing it because of the gangs. </p><p>If we’re honest with each other, with ourselves, this isn’t some misunderstanding about how to most effectively implement immigration policy.</p><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/hed-poll-61-of-trump-voters-agree-with-idea-behind-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-090004062-090004351.html">In 2022, over 60% of Trump voter polled</a> said they agreed with the statement that: “a group of people in this country are trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants and people of color who share their political views.” </p><p>The thing about declaring war on immigration in a country of immigrants is that we might be able to get rid of some percentage of recent ethnic immigrants by bulldozing our way through the constitution — but you can’t do it without breaking the country itself and tearing apart the thing that makes democracy possible: the rule of law.</p><p><strong>Law and Order means </strong><em><strong>everyone</strong></em><strong> follows the law—especially those who swear an oath to uphold it.</strong></p><p>A system is what a system does. And this system is terrorizing families. You and I need to wrestle with this. Whether you realize it or not, you likely know many people who are scared right now because of all this. No matter who you are, you are no more than 1 or 2 degrees away from someone who is living in fear of having their status revoked and being sent back to where an abuser, a bigoted government, or a militarized cartel is just waiting for them to show back up. </p><p>If we’re going to support the way “immigration enforcement” is happening, we have to accept two things: </p><ol><li><p>That we are ok with the rule of law being ignored, something that will impact citizens and non-citizens alike once it is normalized; and </p></li><li><p>We have to be ok with what happens to the people we are sending back, many of whom have fled violence we cannot imagine.</p></li></ol><p>If we are to be honest, awake people, as I know my conservative friends pride themselves on being, we must assume the following is going to happen a decent amount of the time. It may not happen in this precise way, there may be more complexities and opaqueness in the process, but the way things are happening now, we are effectively endorsing things like this:</p><p>We must assume that every time a plane takes off filled with people snatched off the street, their due process and immigration court dates ignored, people on the other side of that flight know about it. </p><p>We must assume that when that plane lands, and the ICE agents shuttle those men, women, and children onto the tarmac, without a peso to their name, the predators they fled from are aware. </p><p>The predators have likely driven to the airport. It’s probable they have photos of who they they’re looking for: people who spoke out, people who did the right thing, people who asked the authorities to follow the rule of law — and they paid the price for it, fleeing the only land they knew as home for a place known to all the world as a refuge for the <em>tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free.</em></p><p>The persecutors, abusers and oppressors, we have to assume the will be there, at the airport, their car idling, checking the time, waiting, waiting. They might be there, parked, waiting beneath a friendly purple sign that says: “Avelo.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png" width="1456" height="1270" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1270,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1630326,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/173950257?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wur_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d97d469-4c97-4384-8457-ce2dca7f012f_1892x1650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div>
