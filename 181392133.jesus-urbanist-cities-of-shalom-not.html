href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/09/22/guerilla-bench-operation-nashville/">primary benchifactor</a>.]</em></p><p>Recently, I had coffee with a friend named Jakob, and we were talking about our city’s treatment of our poorest citizens. On any given night, Nashville has over two thousand people sleeping outside, and every year, over two hundred homeless Nashvillians die as a direct result of their poverty. <em>Two hundred</em> human beings, dying on the street!</p><p>And our city’s response has been like cities all over the country. Our municipal government destroys encampments and takes away benches where homeless Nashvillians often sit. Jakob said he thought <strong>the city treated</strong> <strong>our homeless residents like an illness, a virus - the immune system of our government was trying to do whatever it could to rid itself of this illness.</strong></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jesusurbanist.substack.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe to Jesus Urbanist Here&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://jesusurbanist.substack.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips"><span>Subscribe to Jesus Urbanist Here</span></a></p><p>The problem with this, of course, is that human beings are not viruses. It’s not that encampments are positive places for anyone, homeless or not, or that the decorum of every person who spends all day on a public bench is unproblematic. To see a human being suffer in public is painful. To see a person languishing in horrible poverty and illness, while at the same time surrounded by opulence, is horrific. The city responds to homelessness not as an issue of human suffering, but as an issue of public image and the comfort of the wealthy. Destroying encampments and removing benches won’t save the lives of two hundred people, but it can make the rest of us more comfortable.</p><p>It’s in this context that our mayor has sent a resolution to the city council to affirm a $15 million “public safety” grant for a local business improvement district called the Nashville Downtown Partnership (these are the same folks behind the removal of the benches). They claim that this grant will be used to increase public safety, and it includes things like armored vehicles, AI-powered social media monitoring, real-time camera networks, and mobile command centers. These are often literally the same tools as those used by ICE, and <a href="https://www.fivecast.com/educational-resources/violent-protest-activity-osint-case-study/">the website of one of the tools</a> even proudly presents how it monitored activists online to predict and suppress a protest.</p><p>All across the country, our cities are facing increased militarization (often by the literal military), policing, and surveillance, and all this in the face of a new embrace of unregulated AI tools. The context here is complex. But as someone who orders my life to the teachings of Jesus, and whose first priority is concern for my neighbor, especially the foreigner and exile, the poor, the widow and orphan, my mind keeps going back to this question:</p><h4><strong>What brings my community peace?</strong></h4><blockquote></blockquote><h3><strong>Safety Vs. Peace</strong></h3><div class="pullquote"><p><em><strong>“They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious.<br>‘Peace, peace,’ they say, when there is no peace.” - Jeremiah 6:14</strong></em></p></div><p>In conversations about homelessness, encampment, public space, and surveillance, we often end up speaking about <em>safety</em>. We talk about how to prevent violent crime and drug use, but our conversations miss the mark. Instead of talking about safety, we should be talking about <em>peace</em>.</p><p>Safety implies merely that an individual is out of harm’s way, and it is not of primary concern in scripture. Peace, on the other hand, is of utmost importance in scripture. <strong>Where safety is individual, peace is communal. Where safety ignores the suffering you cannot see, peace concerns itself with the wellbeing of all people, those we know and those we do not know.</strong></p><p>Peace in Hebrew is <em>shalom</em>, and it means wholeness. It refers to something complex with lots of pieces and nothing missing; for example, Job refers to his flocks of sheep as in a state of <em>shalom</em> because none were missing. The term can also be applied to human relationships; in Proverbs, shalom is achieved when estranged people are brought back together. The relationship is made whole once more.</p><p>Homelessness is not an issue of crime any more than it is a virus to be attacked by a city’s immune system. <strong>Homelessness is one symptom of a culture lacking in shalom.</strong> We have been made estranged from one another, and we have not remembered that we are our brothers’ keeper. We are missing our siblings, and they are left to sleep on the streets in utter destitution, and every year across the US, tens of thousands of them die there.</p><p>The thing is - surveillance <em>might </em>make a society safer - as in, <a href="https://ericpiza.net/2020/12/02/cctv-review/">it might reduce some kinds of crime</a>. <strong>But adding cameras and armored tanks is a lot like destroying encampments and removing benches - it doesn’t restore us to wholeness.</strong> Instead, bolstering surveillance erodes our civil liberties and jeopardizes the safety of vulnerable groups, especially immigrants and the homeless. It creates mistrust between citizens and their government. Surveillance does nothing to bring us peace, even if it temporarily gives some people a sense of safety.</p><p>Increasing surveillance, removing encampments, taking away shared public spaces - these are actions of a government which wants to <em>appear </em>safe so that the privileged do not have to see those things which make us uncomfortable. These are reactions, not responses, which allow the powerful to boast about how they have improved our community, without doing the hard work of bringing peace. In other words, it allows them to claim a false peace.</p><p>To say “peace, peace” when there is no peace is a sin.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg" width="500" height="371" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:371,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Tw4g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88b25ec1-c9b5-43e7-a179-3e626cb5d3ea_500x371.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">“Homeless Jesus” Icon by Kelly Latimore</figcaption></figure></div><p>We are coming rapidly upon Christmas, the celebration of the birth of the a little child. He was not/is not the mighty warrior that so many hoped for, but instead - the Prince of Peace. The birth of Christ, who was born in a makeshift shelter and soon after was a refugee, is the ultimate acknowledgement of God’s solidarity with the earth’s poorest.</p><p>Christian urbanism contends that our built environments reflect this ideal. The city exists for human flourishing. <strong>In Christian urbanism, our built environment is not morally neutral; every bench maintained or taken, every sidewalk and bike lane built or destroyed, and every grant a city takes is morally weighty.</strong> In understanding our cities through this lens, we try not only to build safe communities - but cities where shalom, real peace, reigns.</p><p>And while a city built on shalom might seem like a far-off ideal, we already know many practical ways we can build for peace. We can change zoning laws so housing is more diverse and accessible to all kinds of families; we can design roads for people and not cars, and therefore preserve human and animal life; we can create more nimble, well-staffed, responsive bureaucracies that respond to people’s needs - especially in times of crisis.</p><p>In fact, the Nashville Downtown Partnership’s application for the $15 million dollar grant included some things that would bring us closer to shalom and not mere safety. Things like personnel and training costs, architecture and engineering costs, and renovation and rehabilitation of existing buildings - things that, applied correctly, could help us create a community for the flourishing of all our citizens - not merely the most privileged among us.</p><p>If the city so desperately wants this grant, then let them take it and spend it on things that bring our community real and lasting peace. Let them spend it in ways that honor the value of each human life, and not on security measures that endanger our most vulnerable citizens, erode public trust, and serve to create a false sense of peace.</p><p>Maybe some would consider it foolish to strive for a city built on the ideals of love and human flourishing, to build with shalom in mind. Echoing St. Paul, Dorothy Day wrote, “We confess to being fools and wish that we were more so... in the face of bread shortages and housing shortages... we face the situation that there is nothing we can do for people except to love them.”</p><p>So if we are foolish for following the Prince of Peace - let us be fools. The Nashville Downtown Partnership builds a city where they can cry “peace, peace” - but that is not what they are building for. They reach for surveillance and policing to maintain the safety and comfort of the wealthiest people at the expense of the poorest.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jesusurbanist.substack.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe to Jesus Urbanist Here&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary button-wrapper" href="https://jesusurbanist.substack.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips"><span>Subscribe to Jesus Urbanist Here</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>If you want to read more about the Nashville Downtown Partnership’s actions and Mayor O’Connell’s MOU, read the excellent reporting by Mike Lacy here on Substack.
