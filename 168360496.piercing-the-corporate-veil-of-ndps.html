<p>In the wake of seemingly non-stop controversies from the Nashville Downtown Partnership (NDP), for some reason residents and business owners of the Gulch are allegedly all very excited that the Metro Council is merging their “business improvement district” with that of the Central District — both to be overseen by NDP. </p><p>It’s not clear if the people living and working in these business districts (a designated area that opt-in via a one-time vote to pay extra taxes for services in their area) know what Council is unilaterally signing them up for by merging these areas and propping up NDP to gain even more power and revenue.</p><p>Last night’s Budget and Finance Committee meeting was a <em>tense</em> showdown between: </p><ul><li><p>Nashville’s gilded elite that have been at the self-appointed helm of <em>beautifying</em> Nashville’s various business improvement districts since 1999, and </p></li><li><p>Council Members who mounted a strategic resistance with hardball questions that boiled down to: “wait, so you have like, no oversight on the use of public dollars? And you think that’s… good?”</p></li></ul><p>Metro Council’s Attorney Margaret Darby confirmed what Council Member Sean Parker first raised at the last budget meeting, and I chased down last week through public records searches to fact check: <strong>Metro Council stopped approving the budgets for the Central Business Improvement District circa 2004.</strong> They left the Downtown Partnership with free reign for 21 years without virtually <em>any oversight </em>on these public funds, and Metro Finance has provided them unauthorized funds in excess of $50M.</p><p>Starts at 1:30:47</p><div id="youtube2-Z1FjK7P8KT0" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Z1FjK7P8KT0&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;5447&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z1FjK7P8KT0?start=5447&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div data-component-name="FragmentNodeToDOM"><p>The funds from Metro don’t flow directly into NDP, they first go into the “District Management Corporation” (DMC) whose primarily and seemingly exclusive function is to receive these funds from Nashville and pass them along to the Nashville Downtown Partnership.

But it didn’t. For 21 years. Which isn’t a de facto approval. It’s in fact supposed to be a denial. For the first few years after the creation of the first business improvement <em>they did</em> approve a budget. Then, as Darby explained, in 2004 it inexplicably stopped. But the money didn’t stop.</p><p>This happened despite <strong>two</strong> internal Metro audits of the two Business Improvement Districts involved in this merger in 2011 which gave the BIDs passing grades, but did mention that the “Nashville District Management Corporation did not have a specific methodology for selecting vendors,” and “competitive bidding was not utilized by the Nashville District Management Corporation to select a significant vendor.”</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://filetransfer.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/InternalAudit/docs/FY2012/GulchBusinessImprovementDistrict_111013.pdf">Gulch Business Improvement District, October 13, 2011</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://filetransfer.nashville.gov/Portals/0/SiteContent/InternalAudit/docs/FY2012/CentralBusinessImprovementDistrict_111013.pdf">Nashville District Management Corporation, October 13, 2011</a> </p></li></ul><p>For some reasons the auditors didn’t look into the fact that none of the money the CBID received was authorized by Council (kind of a boner on their part). </p><p>Nor did they point out that the entity that would have selected this vendor is comprised of <em><strong>literally the same people</strong></em> that select themselves as the vendor — and pay themselves handsomely for being the best people for the job. In 2023 Tom Turner was decided to be worth $485,196 in annual salary at this non-profit.</p><p>As Turner pointed out yesterday when asked if he could commit the Downtown Partnership to dedicate funds to shelter the unhoused: the Downtown Partnership manages only a fraction of a percentage of Metro’s overall budget. Passing the care for a theoretical sliver of the 2,500 and growing Nashvillians without an home onto him is an unfair burden! Turner <em>merely</em> makes 2.6 times what the Nashville Mayor makes who oversees a $3B budget — why should Turner’s organization have to sacrifice some of the money the city aggregates with implicit force from its residents to support people to live indoors? </p><p>Yes of course he supports the unhoused! That is why he tacitly threaten to fire some of his contracted outreach coordinators if he were obligated to provide this type of assistance, which is organization did pre-COVID. Because, as the record shows, he is very compassionate towards these folks! </p><p>Why can’t he just sic his secret police force on the unhoused with no repercussions? Why? Whyy whyy waaa waaa waaa was the sentiment absolutely palpable in the chamber when he was asked to make the most <em>nominal</em> concession to decency before the Council which now, he does not seem to understand or accept, it has been discovered, approves his annual budget (and, we can only hope, compensation). </p><p>By the way, I spoke to some homeless advocates last night and did the math. If you took Mr. Turner’s salary and divided it by the cost of homing someone for one year, you could provide decent housing for 30 people for a whole year. </p><p>But where’s there fun in that? </p><p>Unfettered capitalism fuels innovation, right? </p><p>And what’s more innovative than being your own advisory board and convincing elected officials it’s undemocratic for them to advocate for their constituents?</p><p>The DMC and NDP are the Ying and Yang of our thriving Metropolis. They’re the Hegelian dialectic that creates the twin utopias that are the Gulch and Lower Broad. They are the two faced god Janus emblazoned on the gates of the city, holding back the mongol hordes of the unhoused, keeping them from making the famously demure patrons of Robert’s Western World  uncomfortable.</p><p>What’s the worst that could happen letting these two “independent” entities be fully fused without a drop of oversight in an ocean of public funds?</p><div><hr></div><p>A quick diversion into corporate law theory.</p><h1>Piercing the Corporate Veil: Potential Liability Exposure</h1><p>"Piercing the corporate veil" is a legal doctrine that strips away the protection of corporate separateness when two entities are actually one organization pretending to be two. Tennessee courts will pierce the veil when entities are so intertwined they lack separate identity (<em>Oceanics Schools v. Barbour</em>, 112 S.W.3d 135 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003)).</p><p>In their 2023 IRS filings, Nashville Downtown Partnership (NDP) and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/621747009">the District Management Corporation (DMC)</a> are a textbook example. They don't just share some staff—they share everyone who matters:</p><h4><strong>Executive Staff Overlap</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Thomas D. Turner</strong> – <em>President &amp; CEO / Executive Director</em> of both organizations</p></li><li><p><strong>Tamara Dickson</strong> – <em>Vice President of Economic Development</em> for both</p></li><li><p><strong>Jeanette Barker</strong> – <em>Vice President of Strategic Development</em> for both</p></li><li><p><strong>Jack Malone</strong> – <em>Director of Cleaning &amp; Transportation</em> for both</p></li><li><p><strong>David Corman</strong> – <em>Director of Safety Services</em> for both</p></li></ul><p>Beyond staff, the board overlap is extensive: major property‑owner directors Will Freeman, Gabe Coltea, Janet Kurtz, Joe Bucher, Richard Fletcher, Kelly Hodges, and Michelle Myers serve on both the Nashville Downtown Partnership and the Nashville District Management Corporation boards.</p><p>This complete overlap is made deeply problematic as both entities to violate Metro Code § 2.177.070 for 21 years, spending tens of millions in public assessments without required Council approval. If a court pierces this fictional separation, DMC can no longer hide behind claims of being an "independent advisory board." Instead, it would potentially be fully liable for decades of ultra vires spending, breach of fiduciary duties, and intentional circumvention of statutory oversight, and also on the hook for whatever litigation comes out of the destruction of the Downtown Library.</p><p>As the Tennessee Supreme Court warned in <em>Continental Bankers v. Bank of Alamo</em>, 578 S.W.2d 625 (Tenn. 1979), courts will not allow the corporate form to be used as a "subterfuge" to evade legal obligations. Here, that's exactly what's happening—one organization wearing two hats to wield governmental power without governmental accountability.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>The best defense of why Council should turn a blind eye to who and how this money is managed is that, “technically it’s not a ‘tax’, it’s a special assessment.”</strong> </p><p>Truly we know we’re run by bland nerds who are in desperate need of noogies and far smaller paychecks when their formal arguments boil down to a pedantic “well, actually…”</p><p>This irrelevant distinction without a difference seems to have been high up on talking points that the many lobbyists and executives from NDP had disseminated to some Council Members. </p><p>Council Members Kupin and Johnston especially seemed highly skeptical of Council’s authority and even ethical standing to oversee these <em>non-taxes </em>that rightly belong to the “stakeholders” to do with what they want. Never have I seen people who have sought public Office and aspire to more so effusively feign accumulating power for their station. </p><p>Never have I seen such mental gymnastics, rejecting democratic oversight over an <em>obviously</em>, <em>documented</em>,  <em>demonstrably unaccountable and dangerous blight on our city’s safety and reputation</em> somehow “in the name” democratic self-rule, pulling us back from a slippery slope towards… could it be, not letting the same rich people do whatever they want all the time?</p><p>Let me make it clear. I don’t dislike rich people. But I have lived long enough to know that being rich does not make your ideas better, and that when you have no checks to your whims and power it creates messes and tragedies that you can you buy your way out of without learning a thing. </p><p>The poor need to be protected from the rich. And the rich need to be protected from themselves. And the poor just need jobs and apartments, not one way bus tickets and citations for lewd signs on a street that prides itself on being loud and gross.</p><p>But having Council give any say on who is on the board overseeing these millions of dollars? This was a bridge too far. This robbed the “stakeholders” of their god given right to having control of other people’s money.</p><p>I asked one of these Council Members for a definition of these so called “stakeholders.”  I received a very telling definition of the term from a Council Member: “One who holds the stakes.”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Well its good to know who holds the stakes in that district.</p><div

She apparently did not get the memo that these are “not taxes”, which is why the Council, despite literally having the authority to oversee these funds, shouldn’t have any business in choosing who is on the board that oversees them. She said:</p><blockquote><p>Today our Downtown consists of 3,500 property owners, 21,000 residents, 85,000 people coming to work downtown, and these residents, business and property owners overwhelmingly supportive of this tool and are happy to <strong>tax</strong> themselves…</p></blockquote><p>If I were a resident of the Gulch Business Improvement District or the Central Business Improvement District, I might ask: </p><p>“So, are my ‘non-taxes’ that I am <em>forced</em> to pay <em>the government</em> going to be used to cover the Downtown Partnership’s liability for their vendor who apparently <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/07/14/downtown-library-parking-fire-photos/">exploded the Downtown Library Parking Garage</a> via a truly bizarre number of propane tanks stored in a public facility?” </p><p>It’s temping to wave concerns like that away when there are millions to accumulate and horde over, and it’s not like campaign contributions can come from small donors.

make it illegal for there to be any oversight on how they use funds. There’s a thing about entitlement. It’s actually a mental health issue, one that makes you deeply unhappy because the world will never conform to your expectations.
