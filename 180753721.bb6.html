<p>I have a thing where I bully bullies. And it’s not good for me. I’m hoping if I say that out loud it’ll help me stop doing it. I guess I more or less believe in “they go low, you go high.” But my vibe is more like, “they start lying, and you speak really, really slowly and precisely and catch in a logic trap of their own making” like a syllogistic venus fly trap. It’s not got Michelle O’s sunny disposition to it though. And spend enough nights staying up until 2 am parsing other people’s untruths and you start asking yourself what you’re getting out of it.</p><p>But the bullying bullies thing. I’ve been doing that since high school. I was like 5 foot 1 freshman year and weighed less than my sneakers. But I was fast with my tongue and I short circuited a lot of classical attempts at bullying me by being meta about it.</p><p>When a jerk with too nice of a car and dressed like the villainous towheaded boyfriend of cute girl in a music video forced our gym class to listen to his rap mixtape during our rollerskating unit, I helped another kid steal the CD and he burned 200 copies of it. When the “rapper” found out I was partially responsible for his song being ironically blared in the parking lot for a week, he came back with a diss track about me called: “Mike is a ****” (The last word is a four letter slur that rhymes with “Mike” and is probably the least intuitive one you’re thinking of.).</p><p>When this did not put me in my place (because the consensus was that this track was was even more risible than the first single), the decision was made that I was going to get a swirlie. That’s right, the most classic of high school movie villain activities, he and a crony were going to pick me up by my legs and dunk my head in a toilet and waterboard me in the first floor men’s room in the language arts hall.</p><p>I flung my arms to the edges of the stall and gripped with unfathomable strength, and from deep in my core, I started roasting these jabroneys. “Sorry, you’re giving me a swirlie? But ain’t ya afraid you’re gonna be late for the sock hop? Do you think President Eisenhower would approve of these shenanigans? A swirlie?! Ah geeze, fellas, I can’t show up to the malt shop after you dunk me an apple!”</p><p>I didn’t make them laugh. But I was making myself laugh, and somehow this gave me supernatural strength in my fingers and they eventually relented. As the walked out the bathroom door I picked up my backpack and lamented to their backs, “ah man, another high school touchstone I still haven’t experienced.”</p><p>I think that’s me at my meta-aware best. Undercutting the tension, the scripts being played out, by absurdly bemoaning how boring the Matrix we’re living in is being. The muscle comes from being small and being too smart and being othered. And I think those wounds have healed in ways that are fun for everyone involved.</p><p>But I have other wounds that haven’t healed as much, or have given me a psychic hitch in my giddyup. There’s a certain kind of apathy, neglect, wounded solipsism in authority figures that brings out an anger in me. A righteousness that I’d call self righteousness except it wiley, and it knows how to find the situations where it is a vulnerable <em>other</em> that is being neglected to hone in on. I scan the situation like a terminator, classifying precisely what kind of self delusion is behind the ineffective policy, the broken promises, the human lives slipping between so many cracks that you start to wonder if our society is just one big colander.</p><p>These problems always find me the way a bottle always finds an alcoholic. I can’t not say something, and too often when I do say something, it is the right thing to say, so how can I ever not. Who else gives enough fucks to not give any fucks? There’s a kernel of it there. The fixation on righting the world’s wrongs, on comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable, a lot of it is about filling the leaky vessel labelled “confidence that someone will be there to protect you.” If I am ever finding the vulnerable and ringing society’s big red button that signals “associate needed at self checkout, please”, then I am never the one who has to be vulnerable.</p><p>And the fear, unlike the awkward ostracism being a runt was (the outsiderness that gave me a sense of humor and something to say), this fear, the terror transmutes easily to anger. And only anger for a <em>just cause</em> and by god is it certain it’s right, but rarely, never, is it helpful.</p><p>For a long time I didn’t want to be able to “be normal.” I had a bit of that Gen-X bug to “not be a sell out.” I signed my passport and driver’s license “Dick Cheney” as a bit, because who could ever be taken seriously who did some shit like that. But I think there was also a lot of terror behind that, and stemming from that rage. Rage, “Μῆνιν” in the Iliad, the fuel of Achilles, the sense of deserving, to be a breed apart, because the alternative isn’t normal, it’s <em>nothingness.</em> The anger finds a cause and it acts on it, and it finds the bullies to bully. And there’s a word for bullying bullies. It’s bullying.</p><p>I relate very well to the unhoused and the incarcerally afflicted for being from a suburban idyll that wanted for things to want for. There’s a <em>you get it</em> I share with those who’d struggle to get a “straight job.” I feel like some demimortal that can walk between worlds and code switch class to some extent. A daywalker amongst the liberals, able to talk conversational legalese and navigate elected company, but always I’m waiting for my lunch to spill out my backpack and have everyone see how undomesticated I really am.</p><p>It’s been a thrill and a panic attack developing a journalism muscle. I feel born for it: my mind Olympic-level at parsing between danger, deception and dumbness. But I also may be too wild for it. Too much <em>a little crazy, but that’s the point.</em> Too impatient to hold my tongue and too principled (or impractical) to not shout the truth as soon as it slams me in the chest.</p><p>The truth isn’t hard for me to ferret. A lot of that is be resigning most of my allegiances. I think reality doesn’t hide itself, we hide ourselves from the world with our hidden commitments. And if you pledge yourself to <em>truth</em> whatever the consequences, and conflate <em>seeing the world for what it is</em> with being cool, you shed many of your preconceptions – and the world is less and less a puzzle and more a dance. A savage, backstabbing, transcendent, magnanimous dance. But there’s more to being a newshound than having a nose for the truth.</p><p>The breed that gets to keep the bylines are house trained, and no there’s guests that, no matter how many heirlooms they slip into their birkin, you’re not supposed to bark at.</p><p>We’ll see if journalism is for me. Prose and weaving the real through stories feels more my speed. There’s something about the 5th estate, being in the world but playing at not of it, that I can’t grasp with both my hands. I have a hard time learning hard truths and saying, simply, “care to comment?”</p>
