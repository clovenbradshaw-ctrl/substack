<p>Yo! I’m honestly really grateful that you decided to support me on here on Substack and I hope you’re as excited as I am for changes we can make together. There’s a lot of darkness in this world, and people sometimes ask me “is it a bummer to thinking so much about stuff like this?”</p><p>I think back to the first real job I had out of college. I was a media coordinator at a prisoner reentry program in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was run by a former governor of the state who was likely neither the first nor last Governor of New Jersey to have resigned in disgrace. The other leader of the organization was also a pretty big psycho. He was considered qualified to run the org because he’d spent 16 months behind bars for a drunk driving hit and run that he tried to blame on a subordinate at his law firm (he had since been disbarred).</p><p>So say the vibes were ~toxic~ is an understatement. I felt like I was seeing the worst of suit-wearing humanity. These were people who were absolutely psychotic if you didn’t add two spaces after a period in outward facing documents (a give away that a lawyer wrote a press release I learned), but never met a workplace harassment rule they didn’t want to gleefully break.</p><p>But at the same time, I met a bunch of returning citizens, ex-cons, who gave me a lot of hope. Especially the murderers. The guys who’d spent 30 years on the inside, usually for something they did before the age of 20, the ones that survived and now were showing up to our wack-ass facility to get their drivers license reinstated and talk to a social worker — these guys had become zen the hard way. </p><p>None of the ones I knew denied what they were incarcerated for. I’ve met other folks in prison for that long, some who were on death row (and were finally released when the state admitted it didn’t have evidence to hold them). The time you do when you know you’re innocent changes you in a different way. But three decades <em>knowing</em> you’re culpable, if you can keep your spirit alive, it does something to it. It deeply democratizes you.</p><p>And that’s what I’ve always found when turning over rocks and finding the most abhorrent creatures underneath them. It’s indeed a horror show, peeling back the layers of power. But you meet other rock collectors along the way, and they’re the best people you could ever know — as inspiring as the disgraced politicians and disbarred lawyers are unsettling.</p><p>This is my weird way of saying thanks. And asking: <strong>Do you have any specific things for what you’d like to see covered?</strong> Reply to this if you’ve got anything.</p><p>And here’s an offer if you’re at all interested:</p><p><strong>I’d be down to share a google doc of any pre-published articles with you and give you comment access.</strong> You’d really be doing <em>me</em> a favor by being another set of eyes,  collectivist style editing. It’s not exactly a <em>perk</em> in the way Substack suggests I offer them, but it’s what I’ve got for now. Reply to this if you’re interested.</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>-Mike</p>
