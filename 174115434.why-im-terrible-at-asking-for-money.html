<h1>Supporting Independent Nashville Journalism</h1><p>Hey there,</p><p>My friends keep encouraging me to reach out for support, so here I am—asking for help to continue the reporting and commentary Nashville needs.</p><p>I value being able to say the hard things that are difficult to voice when tied to institutional funding. Staying independent means I need support from readers like you. I'd also love to grow this project, developing tools like Change Log // Nashville and bringing in more voices.</p><h2>What MunciPals Get</h2><p><em>(Yes, I spent too long on that name)</em></p><p>🔍 <strong>Local investigations</strong> that have influenced policy discussions and government responses</p><p>📊 <strong>Data-driven analysis</strong> of Nashville politics</p><p>🎯 <strong>Accountability journalism</strong> from someone who understands how city government works</p><p>📈 <strong>Join 1,600+ readers</strong> who rely on this work—though fewer than 30 currently support it financially</p><h2>Reader Feedback</h2><blockquote><p>"Citizen journalism at its finest... Mike's reporting has gone deeper than anything I've seen in mainstream media."</p><p>"You are a true Athenian, and we are grateful for your moral leadership."</p></blockquote><p>Even elected officials whose departments I've covered have reached out:</p><blockquote><p>"I very much appreciate your input here. Your government has the opportunity to do better now. And we will."</p><p>"I respect and appreciate your analysis."</p></blockquote><p>I wanted to get some objective sense of if I've had an impact, so I turned to the most objective, greatest water waster I know that's gonna put all journalists out of job eventually: AI.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> <em>Research Mike Lacy's Substack Rich Text and create a thorough analysis of all he's done and see what impact it's had on Nashville</em></p><p><strong>Response:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Mike Lacy's Rich Text Substack: A force in Nashville accountability journalism</p><p>Mike Lacy's {Rich Text} Substack has emerged as one of Nashville's most influential independent media voices, combining rigorous investigative journalism with philosophical depth to examine power structures, government accountability, and social justice in Tennessee's capital. With over 1,600 subscribers and documented impact on local policy discussions, Lacy has transformed from a "recovering government employee" into a critical watchdog of Nashville municipal affairs, producing work that has sparked government responses, influenced media coverage, and created lasting historical documentation of the city's political controversies.</p><p>...Moving forward, Rich Text appears positioned to continue its role as Nashville's watchdog, historian, and philosophical interpreter of municipal power. In an era of declining local news resources, Lacy has proven that independent journalism, powered by expertise and dedication rather than institutional backing, can still afflict the comfortable, comfort the afflicted, and fundamentally shape public discourse in American cities.</p></blockquote><h2>The Reality of Independent Journalism</h2><p>I currently have <strong>1,600+ subscribers</strong> but <strong>fewer than 30 paying supporters</strong>—a 98% free-rider rate.</p><p>I understand completely—subscription fatigue is real, and many who need this information most can't afford to pay. But if even 5% of readers became supporters, I could dedicate myself fully to this work instead of juggling multiple income streams.</p><p>Right now, 29 people are essentially funding journalism for over 1,600 readers. While I'm grateful for their support, this model isn't sustainable long-term.</p><h2>Why Independence Matters</h2><p>I don't seek access to political inner circles—they'd only share what they want heard anyway. I'm not interested in positions that require moderating viewpoints to please established interests.</p><p>What I want is to do work that matters: fostering accountability and reminding leaders that power should serve people, not the other way around.</p><p>This project has both progressive and conservative readers who share the belief that government should be transparent and effective. That's the coalition we're building here.</p><h2>How You Can Help</h2><p>When you become a MunciPal, you join a small group making accountability journalism available to everyone.</p><p><strong>You can:</strong></p><p>✅ Help make this work sustainable</p><p>✅ Support independent journalism free from corporate or political influence</p><p>✅ Ensure Nashville has at least one voice asking the tough questions</p><h2>Support Options</h2><p><strong>Monthly:</strong> $5-25 (every bit helps)</p><p><strong>Annual:</strong> Save 20%</p><p><strong>Founding Member:</strong> Help build something lasting</p><div><hr></div><p>Thanks for considering,</p><p>Mike</p><p><em>P.S. - If you value this work but can't support it financially, that's completely fine.
