<div class="pullquote"><p>We know the story of collapse – or at least it is vivid in our imagination. We have much less imagination of the timeplace on the other side of it. What we cannot imagine is more difficult to create. And what cannot be created cannot become so. Thus, the far horizon story should always take place beyond the apocalyptic time when everything completely fell apart and the skies were dark for so long no one knew lightness nor blueness. It is there and then we need to practice into.</p><p>— Norma Wong <br><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/760844/when-no-thing-works-by-norma-kaweloku-wong/">When No Thing

coming. </h3><p>For some, it’s already here. Has been here. But for others—despite the urgent warnings from prophetic voices like <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/aftynbehnfortn/p/black-women-deserve-better-than-a?r=2112f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Rep. Aftyn Behn</a>—the shock is still ahead. </p><p>We’re watching the wholesale scrapping of public services, the possible <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/what-is-doge-doing-to-social-security/">unraveling of Social Security</a>, and the quick, gleeful slaughter of federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development—agencies that quietly keep millions of men, women and children indoors every night.</p><p>We’ve never had a robust social safety net in America. Compared to other Western countries, our net is made out of duct tape and rubber bands—designed not for dignity, just mere survival. And now, we’re watching it tear in real time. Our interconnected system with too few firewalls, no redundancies, and not nearly enough imagination is beginning to buckle. And when systems fail like this, they fail unpredictably.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

spike in homelessness that floods our schools and ERs? Will the unraveling of Medicaid lead to untreated illnesses, draining the workforce and closing hospitals? Maybe a sudden halt to food aid pushes families into desperation, overwhelming food banks and turning classrooms into crisis centers. Could tornado relief get lost in a backlog of invoices when an unmanned AI bot in the Treasury Department glitches out? Will slashes to Social Security send elders en masse into the already overburdened shelter system?</p><p>What’s most likely: several of these—and many others—all at once.</p><p>We don’t know which domino falls first—only that they’re all lined up. And there’s no grand Plan B. No Project 2026. There’s only the illusion that someone <em><strong>someone</strong></em> understands and controls the system, that it will hold, that we won’t be next.</p><blockquote><p>YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED. <strong>Roughly $24.5 billion of Tennessee’s budget—41.9%—comes from federal funding.</strong> Our hospitals, schools, nutrition programs, housing supports, and community clinics depend on these dollars to function. And yet, not a single member of the supermajority can seem to give us a straight answer about what happens next. No contingency plans, no transparency, no real sense of urgency.</p><p><a href="https://aftynbehnfortn.substack.com/p/black-women-deserve-better-than-a?r=2112f&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">Rep. Aftyn Behn</a></p></blockquote><p>I don’t see this collapse as a “possible future” we might avoid if we just “get our sh*t together.” I see it as inevitable.</p><p>Not because we lack the resources for it to be otherwise. The money is out there— it’s within the city limits. It’s sitting in donor-advised funds at philanthropies, parked in real estate portfolios owned by private equity firms, wrapped up in healthcare executives’ compensation packages that trickle down into memberships at Belle Meade Country Club.</p><h3>But the wealth won’t be shared. </h3><p>We haven’t internalized—at the level of our epigenetics or our collective unconscious—how deeply we actually are in this together. That awareness simply hasn’t sunk in.</p><p>We’re not, I’m confident in predicting, going to realize that there’s already enough. There won’t be a collective, psilocybin-fueled Ebenezer Scrooge awakening where the ultra-wealthy realize their errors and right the ship before it sinks. Because that’s just not what we do. As Tennesseans, as Americans—maybe even as humans—we don’t prevent disaster. We let the cascade happen.</p><blockquote><p>“The usual state of nature is recovering from the last disaster.” </p><p>-James S.A. Corey</p></blockquote><p>So, let’s stop pretending we’re going to stop the apocalypse. And let’s stop pretending that a self-made social catastrophe is when He will winnow the wheat from the chaff. That’s spiritual immaturity. </p><p>It’s time we put away childish things and recognize how complex, interconnected, and terribly material <em>and</em> spiritual the world is at the same time. </p><p>Let’s sit with that.</p><p>And when we’re ready—</p><p>Let’s talk about how we’re going to design our systems after it. After the fall. After the cascade and collapse.</p><h3>That’s the real conversation. </h3><p>Because <em>things will change</em>. And <em>we</em> will be changed—by what we’ve lived through. What we’ve done to ourselves.</p><p>Soon, more of us will come closer to hopelessness than we ever imagined.</p><p>There’s a spiritual secret that’s kept from those who see salvation coming in “the next life” and build their society into a pyramid in that image. Should we tell them the secret?</p><p>Many of us in the coming years will slide down the pyramid of social status and physical security, becoming vulnerable in ways that haunt our sleep today. </p><p>But that gives us a strange kind of insight: When we hit the bottom, broken on the first rung of Maslow’s hierarchy, when we live the experience of true vulnerability, what kind of society will we be dreaming of?</p><p>Let’s use that question.</p><p>As a starting place: how are we serving the most vulnerable in Nashville right now?</p><p>What can we learn from the systems we have today —systems for people for whom the apocalypse has already arrived?</p><p>People who wake up every day with no guarantee of food, housing, or safety.</p><p>Because soon, more of us will be caught up in the alphabet soup of survival: HMIS, PSH, RRH, EBT, SSI, TANF—not as acronyms to slash on a budget sheet, but as lifelines we never imagined we’d need—until the floor gave out.</p><p>So how robust are these systems?</p><p>How humane, intelligible, transparent, democratic, equitable, logical—and just plain helpful—are they?</p><p>The services we have today for the unhoused in Nashville: are these the blueprints we want to follow when we rebuild civilization? Would we want these systems to be done unto us tomorrow as they are being done unto them today?</p><p>I ask because we may soon have firsthand experience navigating them.</p><p>And when we do, we may not like what we find.</p><p>But by then, those systems will no longer be theirs—they’ll be ours to reimagine.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>In upcoming essays, I will be looking at the system in Nashville that is meant to care for the unhoused.</em> </p><p><em>I won’t be looking for people to blame or particular mistakes to harp on. </em></p><p><em>I’ll be looking at the values behind the approaches we most commonly see, and talk about how we can’t solve problems with solutions that are less complex than what we are trying to fix. </em></p><p><em><strong>And how that is a lesson we’re unlikely to learn until things get much worse for many of us.</strong></em></p>
