Rosenberg, now Director of Data and Innovation in Mayor O’Connell’s office, has publicly explained this arrangement in a way that deserves close examination against the actual documents.</p><p>In an email to Metro Council and no one else (including you’re truly), he described recent reporting on this as <strong>“misinformation.”</strong> </p><p>I do have some clarifications for my original post, namely that Metro does not appear to be a “pass through” for funds, meaning they likely will not hit Metro bank accounts. What should have been said is that “Metro and the district management corporation must submit a letter of agreement that it shall not apply for these funds.” </p><p>This is a distinction that is important, and I will be updating my posts with this clarification. But interestingly, this was not at all what Rosenberg wanted to rebut.</p><p>Here is what else we’ve learned since the original posts. Even though the grant opportunity was listed as for the Metro Nashville Government, Mayor’s Office appears to have agreed, seemingly without speaking to anyone would not be applying for these funds.</p><p>Speaking with someone familiar with how this arrangement came about, their claim is all of the surveillance tech was added in there by Metro officials (without consultation with Council) and not NDP. </p><p>This version of events makes it quite clear that the Mayor’s Office was using this grant opportunity to get NDP to buy surveillance technology it knew was not going to get approved through council, and then, as has happened in cities like New Orleans, essentially “borrow it” from the NDP.</p><p>Mr. Rosenberg refutation of claims does not clarify at all what the nature of this arrangement was or how it came into being. Rather, he is clearly seem misrepresenting the nature of the document. It is quite clearly an agreement between Metro, the District Management Corporation, and NDP saying that the latter non profit will be the sole applicant for these funds (even though clearly Metro will in some way be receiving these).</p><p>Mr. Rosenberg appears to be misconstruing this as a document which “restricts” the usage of these funds, something that surveillance skeptics would actually WANT to support. This appears to be counterfactual to the actual contents of the MOU and seems primarily aimed at whipping votes to greenlight surveillance tech council has already shot down multiple times.</p><p>Our best guess of what's happening is that this agreement is likely a required document to be on file for the funds to be transfered to the NDP. </p><p>It's not clear if the Mayor's Office thought they could do this without Council consent, and only learned a month after the grant was awarded, but nothing in this document indicates that it, as Mr. Rosenberg claims, restricts how NDP will use these funds. Quite the opposite, infact, it appears to be the document that entitles them to any of these funds.</p><p>But Mr. Rosenberg’s refutation was quite brief, and did not overly busy itself with citing specific passages of the MOU or the grant, as our coverage did.</p><p>Since he was not inclined to elaborate further, and provided an interpretation of what this MOU is that is directly contradicted by its plain language, let us present, like any good amateur blogger/non-lawyer, a the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_theory_(in_law)">theory of the case</a> </em>grounded in actual documents and legal precedent<em>.</em> </p><p>Mr. Rosenberg is welcome to submit a rebuttal or even cross examine us, he has our email. His response will be republished in full on this platform. Or, at the very least, the next time you’re subtweeting us to elected officials whose vote you need to whip, have the courage to throw us on the ol’ BCC.<br></p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;57666d74-633a-49e2-8024-f55749e987fe&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;They’re Pushing FUSUS On Steroids, While You’re On Vacation&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\&quot;No\&quot; means \&quot;No\&quot;, Freddie.

I was made aware recently that a refutation of the coverage of the MOU the Mayor signed with NDP was submitted to Metro Council Members. As someone who helped highlight these issues, I opened this rebuttal with bated breath, waiting to see where I had messed up.</p><p>I have been horrified by the contents of this MOU and its implications for the safety of Nashvillians I served in the Mayor’s Office of Community Safety, and still try to help in this strange capacity I have here. Nothing in my professional life regarding Community Safety nor the research I’ve done into surveillance has indicated that these technologies have any correspondence with reducing crime and mitigating violence. All academic research points to the fact they they, quite demonstrably, really just exist to empower the criminalization industrial complex, helping fill beds in private prisons to satisfy stockholders, who are then able to pay lobbyists that help this system do it all again <em>but more</em>.</p><p>Here’s an honest question: How can we safely engage with surveillance technology in the light of the authoritarian regime of our federal administration? It’s a question the former data privacy hawk CM O’Connell seemed to care deeply about. But nothing has changed since he took office, except that now he is the one with power (to some small degree that he is allowed it by those above him), and in fact, the risks inherent with these tools are only higher and more dire than before he took office.</p><p>The reality is that there is fundamentally no way for many of these tools to be used safely—especially when provided by third parties that are unaccountable to public oversight. And thanks to the recently enacted Tennessee Information Protection Act, all data processors are essentially immune from any sort of oversight on when and how they share this data with law enforcement — even if that law enforcement is acting in ways that are blatantly unconstitutional.</p><p>But when I heard Rosenberg had rebutted concerns about this MOU, it made me hopeful. “<em>Please, someone, a lawyer, tell me I’m wrong! Show me that this isn’t what it seems.”</em></p><p>Honestly, I was hoping for a lashing. A spanking from a daddy that would tell me I was making a big fuss over nothing. I was hoping for a slap so hard that the scales would fall from my eyes and I would have to submit a retraction that would veritably end my career as a local truth teller. And honestly? I was looking forward to it. </p><p>It’s a real pain in the ass to be the one always breaking the bad news. I was hopeful that Mr. Rosenberg, with his law degree and years of commitment to the public good, was going to school my ass and explain clearly that my former boss, Mr. O’Connell, wasn’t trying to slip dangerous surveillance tools into an MOU covertly submitted just before a holiday, without even giving the Council member whose district it was a heads up.</p><p>But Mr. Rosenberg’s clap back? It wasn’t even a golf clap. Not even that <a href="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c3bc854fe4d72937c30ba1f16d0a96488291474/0_0_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=900&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;s=3c494469554ce1856638bfd84e44f987">weird clap Nicole Kidman did</a> when she was wearing too many rings. It was a whimper. A nothing. It was far shorter than even <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRMp-vWP82cX80PLwt_skNGia82XALQP4VHjNkZF1nAIRUaCkA_zjmL0oOtRQxmlgvic-3ceRbC1YB7/pub">Director Calvin’s rebuttal to my OHS reporting</a>, and somehow even less logically consistent and more disingenuous—and all the more disappointing coming from someone with his education and years of public service.</p><p>Here is the full text of what was sent to Metro Council members:</p><blockquote><p><strong>From Dave Rosenberg:</strong></p><p><strong>RS2025-1659 NDP MOU</strong></p><p>This resolution has been the subject of a significant amount of misinformation. NDP has been awarded a state grant of $15 million and expects to receive the money from the state by the end of December. Under this MOU, NDP agrees to limit the uses of the funds to a finite list, all of which are already permitted by Metro. (Absent the MOU, NDP has the option to apply the funds to a wider list of uses, though they’ve stated they will not do so.) Additionally, NDP will donate most of the grant to Metro, and those donations will be subject to future Council legislation.</p></blockquote><p>That’s it. That’s the entire rebuttal from the Director of Data and Innovation to concerns about $15 million in surveillance technology being routed through a private corporation.</p><p>But just as took place with the OHS coverage, this pattern is revealing. Similar to when I’ve pointed out problems with the Office of Homeless Services that they found not to their liking, messaging went in public forums claiming what I said was, and I quote directly, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7-liIWAJzE8?si=jko1cE-XN_xgyO_x&amp;t=312">fake news</a>.” </p><p>I would like to remind readers that my research was directly responsible for a formal internal audit taking place of OHS, and nothing of substance I have reported has ever been contradicted by Metro. In point of fact, many things I stated were corroborated by Mayor O’Connell’s head of that office in open testimony on the council floor (though it was characterized by her as essentially “growing pains” rather than gross financial malfeasance). When I published a website comprised of public records requests from that agency, an email went out to Metro Council from the Director saying:</p><blockquote><p>“It is unfortunate to see public data used in a way that is misleading or misunderstood which can erode trust in our work to serve the most vulnerable.” </p></blockquote><p>In that case, I was not copied on the messaging to Council no received any specific refutation of that facts I presented. And in this case, again, I have found that employees of Mayor O’Connell have chosen not to submit any corrections to me, but to send them directly to Metro Council.</p><p>This pattern reveals something important: This administration’s approach to “correcting the record” is to message elected officials rather than engage with those who raised the concerns. A PR word to the wise: even if you believe someone is acting in bad faith, the failure to reach out and educate them on “the reality of things”—to at least make the attempt at good faith dialogue—does not present the appearance of an administration operating from a place of transparency or concern for the public good. It presents the appearance of damage control and political spin.</p><p>So, Mr. Rosenberg, if you have any corrections for me, please consider contacting me before throwing out the term “misinformation.” Please consider, as you would before court, putting together your arguments, grounded in actual documentary evidence and not emotions, and give me a call. My phone number should still be on file with Metro HR.</p><p>Or if you want to just go the route of calling us all liars, please, bring your A-game. Because my friends and I, we’re hardly even trying, and still we are changing the way this game is played. </p><p>Here’s rule change number one: <em>You have to try to tell the truth</em>. I know! Annoying. It’s like fighting with one arm tied behind your back. But you’ll be a better public servant for doing it. And Nashville, even if not your boss (and whoever he reports to), will thank you for it.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>The Basic Facts</strong></h3><p>Let’s establish some simple facts before we get into the weeds:</p><p>The State of Tennessee offered $15,028,698 to the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County through the Downtown Public Safety Grant program. The <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/finance/ocjp/DPSG%20Municipality%20Allocations.pdf">official allocation document</a> from Tennessee’s Department of Finance and Administration makes this clear. The <a href="https://www.tn.gov/governor/news/2025/10/2/gov--lee-announces--175-million-in-grant-funds-to-strengthen-public-safety-across-tennessee.html">Governor’s announcement</a> explicitly lists “Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County” as eligible.</p><p>The Nashville Downtown Partnership, despite whatever feelings they may have about this, is not part of Metro government. They are a private 501(c)(6) corporation - essentially a trade association for downtown businesses. They’re not even the entity directly responsible for managing Nashville’s Business Improvement Districts. As per the founding ordinance, in the case of the Central Business Improvement District (CBID), that entity is the Central Business Improvement District Management Corporation.</p><p>The Nashville Downtown Partnership is a vendor contracted by the CBID to provide management services. This distinction may be confusing for many - potentially even for Tom Turner, as he serves as the highest-ranking executive of both organizations. This dual role makes it rather difficult for the CBID to hold NDP accountable when they fail to manage public property effectively (see: the Downtown Library parking garage explosion), but that’s a substack for another day.</p><p>Perhaps because the same CEO/President sits atop both organizations, it seemed logical to someone to put NDP on the grant application. But what the grant process expressly requires is for eligible entities within the same jurisdiction to acknowledge that they won’t be applying for competing portions of the allocation. Metro and the CBID management corporation needed to confirm they weren’t seeking these funds so NDP could apply for 100% of the allocation.</p><p>A Memorandum of Understanding to that effect is what Mayor O’Connell signed. Which raises an important question: can the Mayor unilaterally commit Metro to not pursuing $15 million in public safety funding? That’s a constitutional question for the Metro Attorney to address.</p><p><strong>What’s Actually Being Purchased</strong></p><p>What Dave Rosenberg’s explanation also conveniently leaves out: questions remain about who actually requested several line items in Exhibit A, including:</p><ul><li><p>The armored rescue vehicle</p></li><li><p>Fivecast (the social media scraping digital surveillance tool)</p></li><li><p>LeoSight (the surveillance integration software from the former Chief Revenue Officer of FUSUS)</p></li><li><p>Mobile command centers and tactical support posts</p></li></ul><p>These don’t appear to align with NDP’s stated mission of managing downtown cleanliness and events. It’s unclear why a private nonprofit primarily responsible for keeping Lower Broadway clean would request nation-state level surveillance tools and tactical vehicles. If these items were requested by MNPD or other agencies, that should be disclosed. If they were added to the application without NDP’s knowledge, that raises even more serious questions.</p><h3><strong>The Stakes: This Isn’t Political Theater</strong></h3><p>Before we get into the document analysis, let’s be clear about what’s at stake. This can easily be misconstrued as some tit-for-tat local politics lovers’ quarrel - partisan squabbling over process and procedure. It is not.</p><p>We are discussing the permanent infrastructure of surveillance in Nashville. Once deployed, these systems are nearly impossible to use with meaningful oversight, and critically, once the technology is in place, we actually don’t have control over it.</p><p>Consider just one example: Flock Safety’s standard contract language gives the company sole right to touch their cameras. When Greensboro, North Carolina canceled their Flock contract on September 30th, 2024, the cameras remained up and operational because the police department legally couldn’t remove them - only Flock could. The cameras continued monitoring and collecting data on Greensboro residents with no active contract in place.</p><p>These contracts also typically grant companies broad rights to use collected data however they wish. Under Tennessee’s Information Protection Act, which went into effect in July 2025, data processors have legal autonomy to share data they collect with law enforcement at any level - federal, state, or local - at their own discretion based on “reasonable belief” that a law was violated. This right cannot be restricted at the local level.</p><p>This means cameras and software ostensibly purchased for downtown Nashville become infrastructure that can feed data to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI, the NSA, or any federal agency these companies contract with - and under Tennessee law, Nashville cannot prevent this.</p><p>And let’s not forget: the State of Tennessee is actively working to destroy Nashville’s home rule and take over the city. Every surveillance tool we deploy today is infrastructure that a hostile state government can commandeer tomorrow. The city of Nashville and its elected officials could adopt and incorporate all of these surveillance technologies as much as they’d like, but that infrastructure will become part of Nashville’s downfall in terms of state control. The state of Tennessee will use every one of these tools against Nashville’s leaders.</p><p>This is not abstract. This is not theoretical. This is what we’re voting on.</p><h3><strong>Why Rosenberg’s Explanation Matters</strong></h3><p>Against this backdrop, Dave Rosenberg - Director of Data and Innovation in Mayor O’Connell’s office - torpedoes any good-faith defense by providing a completely erroneous reading of the plain language of the MOU. His argument essentially says: “ACTUALLY, if you don’t like surveillance, you SHOULD vote for this because otherwise NDP can do whatever they want with the money.”</p><p>This is an outrageous, disingenuous, and easily disprovable misrepresentation of what this document is and what it does.</p><p>Here’s why it matters that a senior mayoral official would make such claims:</p><p><strong>On Process:</strong> This resolution was submitted to Metro Clerk on Friday, November 22nd - the night before Thanksgiving weekend - with zero public announcement about an incredibly large investment into surveillance technology of the precise kind that had been shut down multiple times by Metro Council. When citizens noticed and raised concerns, the administration’s response was to accuse them of spreading “misinformation.”</p><p>But the “misinformation” being cited consists of direct quotes from the public documents themselves. The plain text. The actual words on the page.</p><p><strong>On Burden of Proof:</strong> When you submit a $15 million surveillance contract in the dead of night before a holiday, with no public notice, circumventing normal appropriations processes, and purchasing equipment that Metro Council has repeatedly rejected, the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate you’re not trying to sidestep democratic accountability.</p><p>The administration has not met that burden. Instead, they’ve offered misleading explanations that don’t match the documents.</p><p><strong>On Required Candor:</strong> To convince the public and elected officials that you are not disingenuously misleading them after such a duplicitous start to a political effort requires candor and transparency. That candor is woefully missing in the response to alleged “misinformation.”</p><p>Not to give unsolicited advice on courtroom manners from a blogger with a mere liberal arts degree, but when you submit a statement to elected officials about the contents of a legal document, and that statement contradicts the plain text of the document itself, the appropriate response when this is pointed out is not to accuse others of spreading misinformation.</p><p>Metro Council should be offended that the administration thinks you’re stupid enough to believe this. And Rosenberg should understand that any attorney offering this interpretation of a legal document in court would face serious questions about their reading comprehension and good faith. The gap between what the document says and what he claims it says is not a matter of legal interpretation - it’s a matter of basic literacy.</p><p>The rebuttal to the “misinformation” is nothing but a bluff. Sound and fury, signifying nothing.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>What We’re Being Told</strong></h3><p>As you can see from Rosenberg’s statement above, the key claim is: “Additionally, NDP will donate most of the grant to Metro, and those donations will be subject to future Council legislation.”</p><p>This sounds reassuring. It suggests Council will maintain oversight through the appropriations process, and that Metro will ultimately control how these public safety funds are spent.</p><p>Let’s see if the documents support this claim.</p><p><strong>What the Documents Say</strong></p><p>The Letter of Agreement (pages 3-4, 23-24 of the full packet) shows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Metropolitan Government of Nashville: 0%</strong> of total available funding</p></li><li><p><strong>Nashville Downtown Partnership: 100%</strong> of total available funding</p></li></ul><p>The Memorandum of Understanding contains no language about donations, pass-throughs, or future Council legislation. Instead:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Section III.a (Responsibilities of Metro):</strong><br>“Refrain from applying for any amount under the DPSG grant in order to allow the NDP to apply for the full amount of the DPSG grant.”</p></blockquote><p>Metro explicitly agrees not to seek any portion of these funds.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Section II.d (Responsibilities of NDP):</strong><br>“Ensure all expenditures of funds from the DPSG grant appear on the list provided in Exhibit A attached to the MOU.”</p></blockquote><p>NDP must spend the money on items listed in Exhibit A, but there’s no requirement to transfer, donate, or pass funds through to Metro.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Section III.b (Responsibilities of Metro):</strong><br>“Provide a Letter of Agreement related to the application for the DPSG grant.”</p></blockquote><p>Metro’s role is limited to providing documentation that allows NDP to apply.</p><h4><strong>What’s in Exhibit A</strong></h4><p>The restricted spending list (pages 8-9, 29-30) includes:</p><p><strong>Technology:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Safety Cameras: Video-only cameras installed to enhance public safety by monitoring activity and deterring crime</p></li><li><p>Noise Camera Technology: Devices that detect and record instances of excessive noise to support noise ordinance enforcement</p></li><li><p>CSC Video Wall: A centralized display system used to monitor live camera feeds and incidents</p></li><li><p>CSC Software, Leo Sight: Public Safety software allowing all partners to have situational awareness and communicate via mapping and talk channels. Software has accountability metrics, digital evidence storage, and analyst workflow</p></li><li><p>CSC Software, Five Cast: Communication and situational awareness software enabling coordination across multiple safety agencies</p></li></ul><p><strong>Services:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Outreach: Community engagement and support services</p></li><li><p>Safety Ambassadors: Trained personnel who provide a visible safety presence</p></li></ul><p><strong>Capital:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Lighting: Installation or upgrades of public lighting</p></li><li><p>Public Restrooms and Servicing: Safe, clean, and accessible restroom facilities</p></li><li><p>Armored Rescue Vehicle: A protected internal security vehicle to transport MNPD SWAT personnel</p></li><li><p>Mobile Command Post: A self-contained, vehicle-based center deployed to large events</p></li><li><p>Tactical Support Post: A mobile command post used by MNPD SWAT</p></li><li><p>Downtown Tech Center: A centralized hub for managing technology systems, data analysis, and coordination of downtown safety operations</p></li></ul><p><strong>Understanding the Structure</strong></p><p>The MOU establishes a three-party signature structure that’s worth examining:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Freddie O’Connell signs as Mayor</strong> (Metro takes 0% and agrees not to apply)</p></li><li><p><strong>Thomas D. Turner signs as Executive Director of District Manager</strong> for Nashville District Management Corporation (the CBID takes 0% and agrees not to apply)</p></li><li><p><strong>Thomas D. Turner signs again as President &amp; Chief Executive Officer</strong> of Nashville Downtown Partnership (NDP takes 100%)</p></li></ol><p>This structure is significant because NDP is not itself a Business Improvement District. According to the state grant solicitation, eligible entities include “Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and Business Improvement District Management Corporations.” The CBID is a BID created by Metro ordinance. NDP is a private 501(c)(6) corporation that contracts with the CBID to provide management services—essentially, NDP is a vendor to the CBID, not a governmental or quasi-governmental entity itself.</p><h3><strong>Why This Arrangement</strong></h3><p>To understand why the administration might structure the grant this way rather than having Metro apply directly, it’s helpful to look at what’s being purchased.</p><p>Several items in Exhibit A have appeared in recent Metro budget discussions and failed to gain Council approval or faced significant public opposition:</p><p><strong>The FUSUS Video Integration System:</strong> In 2024, Metro Council rejected expansion of the FUSUS surveillance system after learning MNPD had been operating it for 16 months without required democratic approval. The “CSC Video Wall” and camera integration systems listed in Exhibit A represent similar surveillance infrastructure.</p><p><strong>ShotSpotter Technology:</strong> Previous attempts to expand acoustic gunshot detection have faced Council scrutiny over effectiveness and cost.</p><p><strong>Armored Vehicles and Tactical Equipment:</strong> Military-style equipment purchases have historically required Council debate and public input.</p><p>By routing these funds through NDP rather than Metro, the administration achieves several things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Bypasses Appropriations Process:</strong> Metro Council appropriates Metro’s budget. If Metro received these funds, Council would have line-item authority over how they’re spent. With NDP receiving the funds, Council’s only vote is to approve or reject the MOU as a whole.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limits Oversight:</strong> NDP is a private corporation. Even though it’s spending state grant money for public safety purposes, it’s not subject to the same transparency and oversight requirements as Metro departments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speeds Procurement:</strong> Items that might require extensive Council vetting, public hearings, and approval processes can be purchased by NDP and then presumably deployed in partnership with Metro departments.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commits Future Councils:</strong> The grant runs through June 2028. Equipment purchased by NDP may create operational dependencies that effectively commit future Councils to ongoing costs or programs they never voted to establish.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Legal Question</strong></p><p>The Tennessee grant solicitation (pages 10-22) states that Metro’s maximum available allocation is $15,028,698. The Letter of Agreement shows Metro and the CBID taking 0%, with NDP taking 100%. The MOU requires Metro to “refrain from applying for any amount.”</p><p>If the intent truly is for “most of the grant to be donated to Metro” and for these donations to be “subject to future Council legislation,” why doesn’t the MOU say this explicitly? Legal documents routinely specify payment terms, transfer mechanisms, and timing.</p><p>More importantly: <strong>If this arrangement involved NDP donating funds or equipment back to Metro, that would require a gift acceptance resolution with specific figures, terms, and conditions.</strong> That’s how Metro legally accepts gifts.</p><p><strong>Here’s what an actual gift acceptance resolution looks like in Metro Nashville:</strong></p><p>A recent resolution (D-25-13445) accepting a $50,000 donation from BNA Woodland OZ Business LLC demonstrates the proper structure:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Title</strong>: “A resolution accepting a donation from [donor]”</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Authority</strong>: Cites Metropolitan Code § 5.04.120, which authorizes Council to approve donations</p></li><li><p><strong>Specific Amount</strong>: “$50,000”</p></li><li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Clearly states what the donation will fund</p></li><li><p><strong>Operative Language</strong>: “BNA Woodland OZ Business LLC’s proposed donation of $50,000...is approved”</p></li><li><p><strong>Required Signatures</strong>: Recommended by department head, Introduced by Council member, approved by Finance and Legal</p></li></ul><p>The NDP MOU contains none of these elements:</p><ul><li><p>Never uses the words “donation” or “gift”</p></li><li><p>Doesn’t cite Metro Code § 5.04.120 or any gift acceptance authority</p></li><li><p>Specifies no amounts being donated to Metro</p></li><li><p>Contains no acceptance language for any donation</p></li><li><p>States Metro will “refrain from applying” rather than accepting future donations</p></li></ul><p>The plain language of the MOU states precisely what it is about - it’s a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the grant application process, not a gift acceptance agreement with donation terms.</p><p>The absence of such language and structure suggests the arrangement is exactly what it appears to be: NDP receives and controls the funds, spending them according to Exhibit A, with Metro’s role limited to enabling the application.</p><h3><strong>If There Are Additional Agreements, Disclose Them</strong></h3><p>It’s possible that side letters, supplemental agreements, or additional state grant requirements exist that weren’t included in the public MOU. If such documents exist and they do establish donation mechanisms or pass-through arrangements, the administration should disclose them immediately.</p><p>But even if such agreements exist, they would not change the fundamental legal requirement: <strong>For Metro to accept donations from NDP, Council would need to pass gift acceptance resolutions under Metro Code § 5.04.120.</strong> Those resolutions would need to specify amounts, purposes, and terms - just like the $50,000 BNA Woodland donation example above. No such resolutions have been filed or mentioned.</p><p>The fundamental critique remains valid: Why weren’t donation terms in the MOU presented to Council? Why not include them in the public record? Why respond to public concerns by accusing citizens of “misinformation” rather than simply saying “Here are the additional documents that clarify the arrangement”?</p><p>The burden is on the administration to provide complete and accurate information, especially when:</p><ul><li><p>Submitting a $15 million contract</p></li><li><p>Purchasing surveillance technology Council has repeatedly rejected</p></li><li><p>Routing funds through a private corporation to avoid normal appropriations processes</p></li><li><p>Doing so with no public notice, right before a holiday weekend</p></li></ul><p>When you operate with that level of opacity, you cannot then claim citizens are spreading misinformation for analyzing the only documents you made public.</p><h3><strong>What Council Should Consider</strong></h3><p>As you prepare to vote, consider asking:</p><ol><li><p><strong>If NDP will donate most funds to Metro, why doesn’t the MOU specify amounts, timing, and conditions for these donations? Why isn’t this structured as a gift acceptance resolution?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What legal authority does a private 501(c)(6) corporation have to spend state public safety grant funds and coordinate operations with Metro Police?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How will equipment purchased by NDP be transferred to Metro ownership, and who bears liability for its operation?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What role does Council have in approving how these funds are spent after this resolution passes?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why did the administration pursue this structure rather than having Metro apply directly for funds that would flow through normal appropriations?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>If there are supplemental agreements establishing donation mechanisms, why weren’t they disclosed with this resolution?</strong></p></li></ol><h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3><p>This isn’t about whether these public safety tools are good or bad policy. Reasonable people can disagree about surveillance technology, tactical equipment, and enforcement strategies. That’s what democratic debate is for.</p><p>This is about process, transparency, and whether bureaucrats can sidestep democratic accountability by:</p><ol><li><p>Submitting a $15 million surveillance contract in the dead of night before a holiday weekend</p></li><li><p>Providing no public notice despite years of community opposition to these exact technologies</p></li><li><p>Routing funds through a private corporation to avoid appropriations oversight</p></li><li><p>Claiming the arrangement says things the public documents demonstrably do not say - including claiming donations will occur when the document contains none of the required elements of a gift acceptance resolution</p></li><li><p>Accusing citizens of “misinformation” for quoting the actual documents</p></li><li><p>Potentially withholding additional agreements that would clarify the arrangement</p></li></ol><p>The plain text of the MOU shows Metro agreeing not to apply for these funds and NDP receiving 100% of them, with no mechanism for donations back to Metro or future Council oversight.</p><p>If that’s not the actual arrangement, the documents should say so explicitly. If there are additional agreements that clarify how this works, they should have been disclosed to Council and the public. If the administration has been operating in good faith, they should welcome scrutiny rather than dismiss it as misinformation.</p><p>When you’re asking Metro Council to vote on permanent surveillance infrastructure that cannot be easily removed, that can be weaponized by state government, and that creates data pipelines to federal agencies under Tennessee law, you need to earn trust through transparency.</p><p>Submitting this resolution the Friday before Thanksgiving, with no sponsor lined up, purchasing equipment Metro Council has repeatedly rejected, and then offering a three-sentence explanation to Council members that contradicts the plain text of the MOU is not how you earn that trust.</p><p>When legal language and public explanations don’t match, it’s not misinformation to point that out. It’s due diligence.</p><p>When senior administration officials provide easily disprovable interpretations of legal documents, it’s not partisan squabbling to call it out. It’s accountability.</p><p>And when the stakes are permanent surveillance infrastructure in a city facing hostile state takeover, it’s not political theater to demand answers. It’s survival.</p>
