<p>Last Friday I reported on some ongoing issues at Strobel House, Nashville’s first-of-its-kind permanent supportive housing facility. On Thursday, Strobel House celebrated its first year of operations. This first year, as I’ve been updating readers, has been <em>rocky</em>. </p><p>Along with an unreported near-fatal violent incident (which Metro’s Office of Homeless Service’s senior officials were aware of but do not seem to have notified anyone else), an unreported  fire that has caused extensive damage to the second floor of the facility, it’s also been uncovered that the vendor, Depaul USA, was operating without a contract for 10 months (while somehow receiving compensation from Metro).</p><p>In total, Depaul received over $500k for services for which they did not have a valid contract.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Depaul’s Executive Director Chuck Levesque spoke at Thursday’s anniversary for Strobel House, enthusiastic about a continuing partnership with Metro Nashville, which had just inked a deal for $3.5M to get them back in a contract. </p><p>On Monday Depaul posted a <a
