The integration he was advocating for is not what you think. </h4><blockquote><p>The kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both. Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.<br><br>Martin Luther King Jr. <br>August 16, 1967.</p></blockquote><p>King was speaking not in theological terms here, or some political language of the day. King laid out his vision for a new future borrowing terms like “thesis”, “antithesis”, and “synthesis” from 19th century existentialist philosophy, drawing specifically from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit">spiritual dialectic</a> of the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. </p><p>I don’t think this should be interpreted as just King <em>being a nerd</em> referencing some non-theological books he read in seminary. I think we need to see this as King taking very seriously the power of <em>thinking about how we think about things,</em> the power of words to shape our world, the power of our unconscious concepts guiding the metaphysical progress of society, and the need for us to dig deep into all of our global intellectual roots to find the seeds of truth that will show us <em>where we go from here.</em></p><p>I had never heard of Hegel before my liberal arts college days — but it turns out he’s one of the most influential thinkers in history.</p><p>Hegel’s contribution to modern thought was simple. Well, it is actually very complicated and intimidating when you read it, but I think it basically boils down to this:</p><p>Hegel asserted: The world is not changed by one radical action, idea, movement, or people <em>destroying</em> its opposition and winning. History books may be written by winners, but the true essence of change and evolution is not about winning or losing. The evolution of humanity, consciousness, and the universe itself is not fueled by the domination of strong over the weak, or even the righteous over the villainous. Cycles of domination and oppression keeps things where they are. Real history is made through transcendence.</p><p>The trajectory of the universe unfolds from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben">synthesis</a></em> of opposites. Evolution of all kinds, without exception, is the dance between one thing and its exact opposite, it “<em>antithesis”,</em> and this integration or <em>synthesis</em> bring about transcendence — the birth of new things. </p><p>This dance is what’s called “dialectic”, and after Hegel’s contribution, it became the center piece, and debating stage, of all existential and political philosophy to this day.<br><br>Hegel’s examples of dialectic included: </p><ul><li><p>[Being ↔ Nothingness] = Becoming</p></li><li><p>[Freedom ↔ Necessity ] = Self Determination</p></li><li><p>[Subject ↔ Object ] = Absolute Spirit</p></li><li><p>[Identity ↔ Difference ] = Integrated Wholeness </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

non-violence.</p><blockquote><p>“The third way open to oppressed people in their quest for freedom is the way of nonviolent resistance. Like the synthesis in Hegelian philosophy, the principle of nonviolent resistance seeks to reconcile the truths of two opposites—acquiescence and violence—while avoiding the extremes and immoralities of both.”</p><p>via <a href="http://www.critical-theory.com/martin-luther-king-jr-hegel/">Critical-Theory.com</a> </p></blockquote><p>In a 1960 essay <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/pilgrimage-nonviolence">“Pilgrimage to Nonviolence”</a><strong> </strong>King details his path towards promoting non-violence. He explains how this <em>dialectical</em> thinking moved him beyond being a mere “liberal”, a social and political position that puts all hope for humanity in the inherent <strong>reason</strong> of all people. </p><p>Liberalism posits that humans are ultimately good because they all contain the ability to think critically, to reason, and as reason is derived from God (<em>or something like God</em>), if we just let ourselves think clearly, we’ll overcome our vices and start treating each other well. </p><p>In Liberalism, all our problems just come from stinky thinking, and if we just cool down and talk it out, we’ll build a utopia in no time.</p><p>King did not find this convincing.</p><blockquote><p>“I came to feel that liberalism had been all too sentimental concerning human nature and that it leaned toward a false idealism… Liberalism failed to see that reason by itself is little more than an instrument to justify man's defensive ways of thinking. Reason, devoid of the purifying power of faith, can never free itself from distortions and rationalizations.”</p></blockquote><p>While he continued to value liberalism's commitment to reason and open-mindedness, King grew dissatisfied with its overly optimistic view of human nature. Liberalism, in his view, underestimated the pervasive influence of sin, collective evil, and humanity's tendency to rationalize destructive behavior. </p><p>But he also was not compelled by what he called “neo-orthodoxy”, the growing movement of biblical fundamentalism that stressed humanity’s essential distance from God and goodness. This trend in theological philosophy has only grown stronger in the decades since King’s death. </p><p>Neo-orthodoxy, and other stains of Biblical Fundamentalism that have taken deep root in America, is fueled by the opposite idea of man. It is “antithesis” of Liberalism in Hegelian terms. </p><p>In Neo-orthodoxy:</p><ul><li><p>Humans are incapable of controlling themselves without the external support of (a very specific version) of God. </p></li><li><p>Humanity is by definition fallen, in a state of decline and sin, all our natural ambitions and instincts inherently individualistic and sociopathic.</p></li><li><p>Humans are doomed to build a world that is nasty, brutish, and short unless we put our faith and abandon our reason into a revealed text (inevitably particular editions of the Christian Bible). </p></li></ul><p>The precise opposite of Liberalism’s point of view, Fundamentalism posits that not only is man incapable of goodness without God, but the very virtue of Liberalism, humanity’s ability to use <em>reason </em>to guide our actions, should be viewed with skepticism and fear. Critical thinking, science, the humanities, and all their associate virtues of openness, self-doubt, skepticism, and critical inquiry — these are but play things of the devil, tools for our own destruction and subjugation.</p><p>You can see how this dialectic, this dance between these opposites, explains our modern lives, the culture war we live inside and cannot escape from.</p><p>We are told at every juncture: “Pick a side. Don’t give in. Be on the right side of history.”</p><p>But is that how history works? Or is that that the voice of clinging to one side of the dialectic, of holding back the birth of something new, something that transcends the opposites, taking what is true from both sides, and leaving what is no longer necessary…</p><p>King wrote in 1960:</p><blockquote><p>So although liberalism left me unsatisfied on the question of the nature of man, I found no refuge in neo-orthodoxy. I am now convinced that the truth about man is found neither in liberalism nor in neo-orthodoxy. Each represents a partial truth. A large segment of Protestant liberalism defined man only in terms of his essential nature, his capacity for good. Neo-orthodoxy tended to define man only in terms of his existential nature, his capacity for evil. <strong>An adequate understanding of man is found neither in the thesis of liberalism nor in the antithesis of neo-orthodoxy, but in a synthesis which reconciles the truths of both.  [</strong>Emphasis mine.]</p></blockquote><p></p><h4>When MLK spoke to the 11th Annual SCLC Convention, it was with a vision of a transcendence opposites. </h4><p>His speech in 1967 in Atlanta was a radical vision that dared to touch the third rail of American politics during the depths of the Cold War and hottest part of the Vietnam War. King said publicly that there are some absolute truths contained within Communism, and there are lies embedded deep within Capitalism.</p><p>Philosophy is a dangerous thing to mix with public life. </p><p>Those who cling to the way things are rarely have the patience to understand the nuance that people like King are advocating for. His vision was for a society that would be better for <em>everyone</em>. Perhaps some of us would have a marginal amount less material wealth, but we would more than make up for it with deeper spiritual health.</p><p>But appreciating nuance is rarely the pastime of oppressors.</p><p>Socrates was likely not the first philosopher to executed for his “corruption” of the public, and Martin Luther King Jr. was not the last. But perhaps worse than King’s murder is the public whitewashing of his actual message, his dream of a transcendence of opposites to achieve something far greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p>King’s ambition was to overcome the socially and environmentally disastrous faults of (soon to be) late-stage capitalism; he aimed to do this by absorbing the best parts of communistic collectivism. He grounded this in his deep engagement with the West’s most powerful and radical minds, which was <a href="http://www.critical-theory.com/martin-luther-king-jr-hegel/">evident throughout his entire public career</a>. But this through line has been culturally buried under a philosophically and politically impotent dream of a vague post-racial world, without any intellectual, emotional, and spiritual motor for <em>how to get there.</em> </p><p>But it is there for those who want to look.<br><br>56 years have passed since his death. It’s time we took stock again and ask, <strong>where do we go from here?</strong> </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

I’m concerned about justice; I’m concerned about brotherhood; I’m concerned about truth. And when one is concerned about that, he can never advocate violence. For through violence you may murder a murderer, but you can’t murder murder. Through violence you may murder a liar, but you can’t establish truth. Through violence you may murder a hater, but you can’t murder hate through violence. Darkness cannot put out darkness; only light can do that.</p><p>And I say to you, I have also decided to stick with love, for I know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankind’s problems. And I’m going to talk about it everywhere I go. I know it isn’t popular to talk about it in some circles today. And I’m not talking about emotional bosh when I talk about love; I’m talking about a strong, demanding love. For I have seen too much hate. I’ve seen too much hate on the faces of sheriffs in the South. I’ve seen hate on the faces of too many Klansmen and too many White Citizens Councilors in the South to want to hate, myself, because every time I see it, I know that it does something to their faces and their personalities, and I say to myself that hate is too great a burden to bear. I have decided to love. If you are seeking the highest good, I think you can find it through love. And the beautiful thing is that we aren’t moving wrong when we do it, because John was right, God is love. He who hates does not know God, but he who loves has the key that unlocks the door to the meaning of ultimate reality….</p><p>Hate is too great a burden to bear. I have decided to love.</p><p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about “Where do we go from here?” that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. There are forty million poor people here, and one day we must ask the question, “Why are there forty million poor people in America?” And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising a question about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I’m simply saying that more and more, we’ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life’s marketplace. But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question, “Who owns the oil?” You begin to ask the question, “Who owns the iron ore?” You begin to ask the question, “Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that’s two-thirds water?” These are words that must be said.</p><p>Now, don’t think you have me in a bind today. I’m not talking about communism. What I’m talking about is far beyond communism. …Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social. And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both. Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.</p><p>And if you will let me be a preacher just a little bit. One day, one night, a juror came to Jesus and he wanted to know what he could do to be saved. Jesus didn’t get bogged down on the kind of isolated approach of what you shouldn’t do. Jesus didn’t say, “Now Nicodemus, you must stop lying.” He didn’t say, “Nicodemus, now you must not commit adultery.” He didn’t say, “Now Nicodemus, you must stop cheating if you are doing that.” He didn’t say, “Nicodemus, you must stop drinking liquor if you are doing that excessively.” He said something altogether different, because Jesus realized something basic: that if a man will lie, he will steal. And if a man will steal, he will kill. So instead of just getting bogged down on one thing, Jesus looked at him and said, “Nicodemus, you must be born again.”</p><p>What I’m saying today is that we must go from this convention and say, “America, you must be born again!”</p><p>In other words, “Your whole structure must be changed.” A nation that will keep people in slavery for 244 years will “thingify” them and make them things. And therefore, they will exploit them and poor people generally economically. And a nation that will exploit economically will have to have foreign investments and everything else, and it will have to use its military might to protect them. All of these problems are tied together.</p><p>What I’m saying today is that we must go from this convention and say, “America, you must be born again!”</p><p>And so, I conclude by saying today that we have a task, and let us go out with a divine dissatisfaction.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until America will no longer have a high blood pressure of creeds and an anemia of deeds.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until the tragic walls that separate the outer city of wealth and comfort from the inner city of poverty and despair shall be crushed by the battering rams of the forces of justice.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until those who live on the outskirts of hope are brought into the metropolis of daily security.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until slums are cast into the junk heaps of history, and every family will live in a decent, sanitary home.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until the dark yesterdays of segregated schools will be transformed into bright tomorrows of quality integrated education.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until integration is not seen as a problem but as an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until men and women, however black they may be, will be judged on the basis of the content of their character, not on the basis of the color of their skin. Let us be dissatisfied.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout, “White Power!” when nobody will shout, “Black Power!” but everybody will talk about God’s power and human power.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until every state capitol will be housed by a governor who will do justly, who will love mercy, and who will walk humbly with his God.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until from every city hall, justice will roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until that day when the lion and the lamb shall lie down together, and every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree, and none shall be afraid.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied, and men will recognize that out of one blood God made all men to dwell upon the face of the earth.</p><p>Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout, “White Power!” when nobody will shout, “Black Power!” but everybody will talk about God’s power and human power.</p><p>And I must confess, my friends, that the road ahead will not always be smooth. There will still be rocky places of frustration and meandering points of bewilderment. There will be inevitable setbacks here and there. And there will be those moments when the buoyancy of hope will be transformed into the fatigue of despair. Our dreams will sometimes be shattered and our ethereal hopes blasted. We may again, with tear-drenched eyes, have to stand before the bier of some courageous civil rights worker whose life will be snuffed out by the dastardly acts of bloodthirsty mobs. But difficult and painful as it is, we must walk on in the days ahead with an audacious faith in the future….</p><p>When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds of despair, and when our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, let us remember that there is a creative force in this universe working to pull down the gigantic mountains of evil, a power that is able to make a way out of no way and transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. Let us realize that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.</p>
