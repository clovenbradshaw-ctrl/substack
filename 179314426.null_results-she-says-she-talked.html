living in a hotel in California, unable to get a Section 8 housing voucher. The waiting list was closed. Her child support was not coming in. And then wild fires started popping up in the area. She had to leave. To go <em>anywhere but there.</em></p><p>A group out of West Memphis bought her and her young daughter a one-way bus ticket to Nashville, one of the few places in the country she could find that would take her. She arrived at Nashville Rescue Mission (NRM) in May 2024. </p><p>In July 2024, a case manager NRM had some good news to share. Metro Nashville’s Office of Homeless Services (OHS) had selected her and three other mothers for a program promising Section 8 housing vouchers after 12 months of rent assistance. As programs go for the unhoused, this seemed too good to be true.</p><p>Esther had never heard of OHS. She had never applied for housing through them. This was a blessing from heaven.</p><p>In August 2024 she and her daughter were moved into a housing complex called The Ave. Things, from the beginning, did not go well. According to Esther, OHS failed to provide promised food and supplies. The property manager paid out of pocket for necessities, something the property manager confirmed to me. </p><p>After about a month, in September, Kirsney and one of the other mothers were moved to Hillside Crossing, partly because jobs were offered at the complex itself. They never materialized. There things got far darker, in her recollection. Her claims of the living conditions and interactions with other tenants and staff are not included here as they have not yet been independently verified. But if even partly true, they are terrifying.</p><p>In April, Esther received an eviction notice demanding $1,400 or eviction the next day.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>On Saturday mornings, Council Members can be found posting on Instagram at a No Kings Rally. On Tuesday evenings, they can be found happily handing over the crown jewels of oversight, one board and commission at a time, to our local despot. And somehow, through some unfathomable twisting of neoliberal logic, convincing themselves this is somehow <em>more democratic </em>and even, mysteriously, <em>anti-racist.</em></p></div><p>This was shocking to her. She had never yet had to provide rent, it had been paid by the city up until then, as far as she knew. She learned from her case manager that something had happened with the city’s money. The eviction was avoided, but the year of rent paid by OHS? Not  going to happen. She had four months to be 100% self sufficient, or she’d be homeless again, except not even with the Nashville Rescue Mission to house her and her daughter.</p><p>According to her case manager at the non-profit Step Up, who resigned in protest of the conditions families like Esther were being kept under by OHS, she was advised by OHS to inform Esther that she should have been saving her money, and that she should stop homeschooling her daughter and get a higher paying job.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;90b2f891-56b4-4f87-96d3-55e00826acc2&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;In October, 2025, a case manager at the support services provider Step Up’s put in her notice.

Virtually every organization I’ve spoken with that does business with OHS affirms that late, partial, or no payments at all are par for the course with the agency that has been given, along with city funding, $25M of COVID relief funds for “permanent supportive housing support services” (much of which went to very different things, as per my prior reporting).</p><p>See for example this exchange between a housing provider and OHS’s financial specialist Joseph Marsh. Jason, the housing provider is doing everything he can to keep someone placed there by OHS from being evicted. First reaching out on June 20 noting that payments have already not been received for 30 days, the conversation continues until August 18th, when Jason is informed that the person he is trying to reach to resolve this matter promptly is “away from his desk.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

I can confirm that Mayor O’Connell was not directly involved with Ms. Cunningham’s inquiries.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png" width="1498" height="1532" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1532,&quot;width&quot;:1498,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:325401,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/i/179314426?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a47ae3b-9332-4008-bd01-e248251321db_1498x2062.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sruT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa183b181-06d8-47b1-a6ef-dd96d8dd9740_1498x1532.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>When I followed up saying that Ms. Cunningham was claiming that she has spoken, multiple times, to the Mayor himself, the Mayor’s Office stopped responding to my emails.

Freddie O’Connell.</figcaption></figure></div><p>It would seem that this was the system, as designed by Mayor O’Connell (who created the Office of Homeless Services as a Council Member and amended it so that it reported only to the Mayor) is operating as it should—but that she had just stumbled into some technical difficulties.</p><p>She claims the Mayor told her he would follow up with OHS and call her back. After an extended period of radio silence, Cunningham called him again. He said he was “still waiting to hear back from them.” Meanwhile, he kept asking if she was still working, if she was “seeking housing elsewhere.”</p><p>Eventually, she decided to stop contacting the mayor. Left in the dark, Cunningham describes what she thought was likely going on behind the scenes. “The Mayor was going back, telling them [OHS] everything.”</p><div class="pullquote"><p>One Council Member referred to them as “The Imperial Empire”—that these low-wage nonprofit workers who had chosen to spend their lives serving the least of us were somehow villains making our city’s homelessness problems worse. If only they could get out of the way, things could get better, his logic went. He affirmed that this assessment came directly from conversations he had had with Director Calvin. I asked him if he was aware that she actually oversees all of the functions that comprise the CoC. He was not.</p></div><p>This is what it looks like for the Mayor to have sole oversight of the Office of Homeless Services: A family desperately seeking help gets questioned about whether they really need it, strung along with promises of follow-up, then stops calling out of fear of retaliation from the agency she was attempting to file a grievance about.</p><p>The Mayor’s Office eventually ceased communicating with Ms. Cunningham and does not appear to have made any follow-up referrals on her behalf. A Metro Human Relations Commission investigation is now underway—not because the Mayor’s office requested it, but because the affected families themselves filed complaints.</p><p>This is concentrated executive power in action: unaccountable, dismissive, and ultimately cruel to the most vulnerable. With these as the results to show for mayoral autonomy, the Metro Council is being asked to expand this model to every department in the city. And from conversations that have been had with some on Council, they seem inclined to give it to him.</p><h2><strong>No One Is Being Made Whole</strong></h2><p>If Cunningham’s report is accurate, the Mayor’s concern seems to boil down to whether or not she and her daughter <em>really needed</em> a housing voucher, as if this was in his discretion to decide who has the resources to live indoors or not.</p><p>Cunningham and the other family who did not receive a voucher received some amount of follow-up from Metro through the Metro Human Relations Commission. There are purportedly efforts to see if the two families that did not receive a housing voucher, despite being promised one, would be able to receive them.</p><p>The situation is complicated by the fact that the two families are currently permanently housed, and this also raises questions about how the other families were able to obtain housing vouchers despite being on 12-month leases that OHS had them sign.</p><p>The limited housing vouchers that are distributed from MDHA are defined as going towards people experiencing homelessness, and being signed up on a 12-month lease—even one that you cannot afford—does not entitle you to cut ahead of the other thousands of families waiting for these limited resources.</p><p>One theory why some families got housing and others didn’t is that OHS lied about the housing status of the other five families to MDHA and HUD, describing their 12-month leases as “temporary housing.” Given the lack of follow-through on providing the promised year of rent, it turned out to be true enough—but this is not how federal housing vouchers work. A lease is a lease, and if you’re on a lease, you’re not homeless.</p><p>And these 12 month leases, provided through a public records request, are now available for review to anyone with questions on this issue.</p><p>This is the confounding mystery at the heart of it all: What happened to these eight families? Why did some receive vouchers and others not, and how did any actually receive them since they were all signed up for 12-month leases that were executed under the direct supervision of OHS Director April Calvin?<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;c3c7c227-e1d7-4022-b8e5-cd9f0d4b02e4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;On Saturday morning, August 3, 2024, Nashville’s Office of Homeless Services Director April Calvin texted her staff to personally select which unhoused families would receive housing—reviewing confidential case records via text message, removing families from consideration based on their size, and coordinating placements outside the city’s federally mandated Coordinated Entry system that exists precisely to prevent this kind of ad hoc decision-making.&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;lg&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;{Null_Results} Text Messages Reveal OHS Director Hand-Picked Which Families to Receive Housing&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:3407271,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mike Lacy&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Recovering Government Employee // Tom Cruise Expert // Not on socials.&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da3af832-35b7-4540-ad2e-abbf29ae9c37_250x301.png&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:null}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2025-11-10T03:58:32.513Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Kr5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce09c208-8103-45de-a1c8-e0afb1698221_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/p/null_results-text-messages-reveal&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;video_upload_id&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:178456949,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:2,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;publication_id&quot;:2219733,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;{Rich Text}&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SAwm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0e1df60-e27a-4eba-80d8-cf1082cf8d0d_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p>The fault of the two families that didn’t get a voucher, it is suspected, is that they spoke up. By looking for any form of support and clarity on what was happening to them, they unintentionally flagged their status with MDHA as being, in point of fact, housed.</p><p>Was all of this done without the knowledge of the sole person with oversight on this system, Mayor O’Connell? By August, when records show someone from his office (allegedly him) spoke to one of the families in this situation, was this news to him? Why did he not appear to do anything about it? What has been done to prevent this from happening moving forward?</p><p>O’Connell, a former <s>non</s>-voting<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> member himself of the Homelessness Planning Council and the creator of the Office of Homeless Services when he was a District 19 Council member, is deeply familiar with the mechanics of housing vouchers. It is deeply concerning that he, of all people, did not seem to raise alarms when this was brought to his attention by someone directly impacted by it.</p><p>O’Connell has given no public indication that he believes OHS is acting problematically. Repeatedly I have heard it stated that he believes all of those concerned about OHS are acting in “bad faith” and that all concern about Director Calvin are “personality based issues.” Multiple others have said, however, that he has stated to them that it would “look bad” were he to fire a woman of color.</p><p>Currently, a formal internal audit is being undertaken of the office for its problematic finances. $500k of invoices without a contract were paid to DePaul, a scandal admitted to on the Council floor by the OHS director, and possibly tied to the resignation of DePaul’s CEO after 15 years in that job. </p><p>In recent weeks, $86k of unauthorized furniture was discovered to have been purchased on Wayfair without a contract and provided to the developer AGB (in addition to them getting millions of start up funds COVID monies via Metro). That same developer evicted at least 8 OHS placements, getting judgments against them, in some cases in excess of $15,000.</p><p>None of this appears to be a problem for Mayor O’Connell, who seems happy to let OHS go even further off the leash with its $2.4M of Metro Rapid Rehousing Funds (MRRF), which are being used with no oversight whatsoever.</p><h2>What’s MRRF Got to do With It?</h2><p>These “MRRF” monies are being advertised by Director Calvin to Metro Department heads and Council members as a way for them to solve problems related to homelessness.</p><p>In the extremely brief, and suspiciously ChatGPT-looking document provided to the Homelessness Planning Council, there was no methodology regarding how MRRF funds would be used to most effectively help families in need. There was no methodology stated on how the vulnerability of families would be evaluated so that they would be used most effectively for the 3,000-plus families experiencing homelessness in Davidson County.</p><p>There are fears that these funds might be spent, outside of any normal contracts or procurement methodology, with housing providers to move bodies out of the politically inconvenient places and into unsustainable housing situations, and outside any norms or community oversight to make sure these people are dealt with humanely. Without any actual contracts, MOUs, or leases describing Metro’s plans, a completely clandestine program that moves around humans is extremely alarming in today’s political climate.<br></p><div><hr></div><p>Recommended Reads</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

people from places where they are politically inconvenient, and it appears that Council members are already taking them up on it.</p><p>Last month, Council Member Jacob Kupin relocated <a href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/nashville/metro-ohs-cleans-up-north-nashville-homeless-encampment/">several unhoused people from Cement Plant Road</a>, and a pending public records request will determine if he leveraged MRRF funds to do this.</p><p>Where these people went, if they were put into a similar situation as Ms. Cunningham, if they were coerced to sign 12-month leases at rates they could not afford with landlords who only agreed to it because Metro provided them $1,500 of landlord engagement fund incentives—this may be impossible to ever determine for sure, even by those with credentials and qualifications to track and support the city’s unhoused population in the Homelessness Management Information System (HMIS).</p><p>As recently as last week, it was announced that Council Member Joy Styles was removing people from an overpass on Bell Road in her district and would be using these funds.</p><p>In a phone call with me, she intimated that OHS was not the decision-making body behind this, but that this was “her idea” and that she had approached the state, OHS, and MNPD to remove these people. OHS, for their part, claimed it was an initiative brought forth by the state.</p><p>Without any oversight body whatsoever, and with the increasing sidelining of the Homelessness Planning Council on all such topics, the public may never know who is making these decisions. Nashville has a body that meets to discuss plans for encampment closures, a subcommittee of the HPC. It has, at the direction of OHS, been meeting in secret, in violation of the Tennessee Open Meetings Act.</p><p>I have instructed members of that committee to be prepared to have ethics complaints and/or referrals to the state comptroller or district attorney if they continue to meet in private. Committee members have told me that they do not want to meet in secret, but that they’ve been attending these covert sessions as it is the only way there can be any community oversight over what Metro is deciding to do with the bodies that reside in inconvenient places for its Council Members.</p><p>The Homelessness Planning Council members appear to be extremely cautious of its public criticism of Director Calvin. She, and by extension Mayor O’Connell, have authority over virtually every aspect of the Davidson County Continuum of Care—an arrangement which I am told is not replicated in any major city. </p><p>Metro controls all the mandated pillars of the CoC: the coordinated entry system, the collaborative applicant, the HMIS lead, the governance board, and provides staff that enables the HPC to function, including scheduling all meetings and being the sole channel for all mass communications to members.</p><p>These are all positions that the HPC voted for Metro to have, and can, in theory, vote them out of. Members of the HPC I spoke to are scared, however, of speaking about doing this, considering it essentially treason. Many times I have been told about how communications between members of the HPC and its subcommittees are discouraged, even though this is a fundamental necessity for them to communicate with each other on a daily basis to serve our unhoused.</p><p>When I spoke with a Metro Legal lawyer about how HPC members feel that the Tennessee Open Meetings Act is used against them to keep them from communicating, he said that unfortunately that is how the state law requires things to be since the HPC is, by Metro Legal’s definition, a Metro entity (even though Legal also appears to affirm that it has zero oversight authority over Metro funds or policies for the unhoused). He advised that if people did have any communication outside of publicly noticed meetings, even if not about official business, they should disclose this at the next public meeting.</p><p>Despite Nashville’s Continuum of Care being entirely neutered under the reign of Mayor O’Connell, I have heard a frequent refrain from Council members disparaging the organizations, leaders, and even case workers within the Continuum of Care.</p><p>One Council Member referred to them as “The Imperial Empire”—that these low-wage nonprofit workers who had chosen to spend their lives serving the least of us were somehow villains making our city’s homelessness problems worse. If only they could get out of the way, things could get better, his logic went. He affirmed that this assessment came directly from conversations he had had with Director Calvin. I asked him if he was aware that she actually oversees all of the functions that comprise the CoC. He was not.</p><p>The Star Wars metaphor does seem apt to me. But it seems like he has the roles confused.</p><p>Another Council Member, who had directly overseen an encampment closure in her district, had conspiracies about these entities. She believed they were keeping people living out of doors out of profit motive, that they would stop receiving funding if these people were to be moved indoors.</p><p>When I informed her that some of these very groups she was talking about were offering to serve people that had been moved into temporary housing by OHS, with no clear route to long-term housing, she said she would be very surprised if that was the case.</p><p>With only Director Calvin and Mayor O’Connell’s word to take on what is happening with homelessness, it falls onto people like me to actually talk to people experiencing homelessness and those working to help them to find out what is actually happening.</p><p>The truly staggering part? Council members appear eager to hand over their oversight authority while taking at face value the claims of the very people who benefit most from not being watched. With no clear benefit to Council Members surrendering this oversight, it is hard to attribute to anything but a deep fundamental mistrust of the humans they are meant to serve, and a backsliding to the exact kind of authoritarian overreach that their social media profiles are filled with denouncing.</p><p>On Saturday mornings, Council Members can be found posting on Instagram at a No Kings Rally. On Tuesday evenings, they can be found happily handing over the crown jewels of oversight, one board and commission at a time, to our local despot. And somehow, through some unfathomable twisting of neoliberal logic, convincing themselves this is somehow <em>more democratic </em>and even, mysteriously, <em>anti-racist.</em></p><h2><strong>The Push to Eliminate Democratic Oversight</strong></h2><p>Council members are being convinced that having all department directors be mayoral appointments is somehow progress. The justifications shift depending on the audience:</p><p>“It’s about efficiency”—as if democracy’s checks and balances are just red tape to be eliminated.</p><p>“It’s depoliticization”—as if putting these decisions in the hands of the county’s highest elected political official will somehow remove politics from the equation, or that politics, the push and pull of differing interests, is inherently <em>bad</em>.</p><p>“It’s anti-racist”—the most insidious argument, painting diverse community boards as opportunities for bigots while claiming that concentrating power in one person’s hands is MORE democratic than having boards with appointees from Metro Council, the Mayor’s office, and the community itself.</p><p>They’re asking us to trust that once every four years, we’ll pick someone who will make good decisions on all these things. And in the meantime? Just text him. Or call him—though if you’re a mother facing eviction, don’t expect much more than questions about why you need help. Questions that feel much more geared towards answering <em>what does she know? </em>than <em>what can I do?</em></p><p>Elinor Ostrom won a Nobel Prize in Economics for proving that nested hierarchies of decision-making are how functional systems maintain and grow to meet changing conditions. That looks like boards and commissions with people appointed who have the greatest incentive to get things right. </p><p>That means filling boards and commissions with those with direct experience of the things they’re supposed to oversee. That isn’t how they’re used now. They’re used as holding pens for people who want to run for future political office, as patronage, as back scratching. <em><strong>That</strong></em> is why they do not work. Not because they distribute authority, but because many people on boards and commissions have no business being on there.</p><p>It is, in point of fact, the duty of those who appoint people to boards and commission to select people who do have expertise, from a diverse array of perspectives, to be on that bodies.</p><p>I genuinely believe that there are many who select the names for these positions who do not understand this. When I was in the Mayor’s Office and there were vacancies on boards, the question asked of anyone nominated was not “are they qualified?” but “are they a Cooper person?”</p><p>If there are people in elected positions who don’t understand why this is problematic, I am not here to teach them a civics class (though I willingly would if they paid me). I am here to say that that is not a perspective on how our local democracy should work that will win elections moving forward.</p><p>But hey, if you lose your election in a blowout, you never know —  the Mayor might unilaterally put you in charge of, random example, the Entertainment Commission.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.
