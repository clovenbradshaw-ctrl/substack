Two events, six hours, and one mile apart told the entire story of Nashville's homelessness crisis.</strong></p><p>First was the general meeting of the CoC, the coalition of public and private organizations serving the unhoused, called the <strong>Continuum of Care.</strong> At 10:30 am, a hundred odd social-worker-types sat at tables in a large meeting room at Nashville's Rescue Mission, submitting anonymous questions onto large televisions. The TVs projected an app, <em>Mentimeter,</em> a collaboration tool employed of late at CoC meetings to elicit feedback from the room anonymously. </p><p>Ever since Nashville's Office of Homeless Services (OHS) gained control over the three levers of structural power that govern the Continuum of Care, the collective sense of <em><a href="https://www.academia.edu/download/100996028/j.hrmr.2017.01.00120230412-1-taev69.pdf">psychological safety</a></em> within the CoC, I’ve been told, has been dropping. The use of tools like “Menti” is one of its symptoms. The other more common symptom is silence.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png" width="1076" height="108" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:108,&quot;width&quot;:1076,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:24671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/171619020?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!To1T!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66aefdef-cff5-4ba7-8170-663be66b67a2_1076x108.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><strong>Clarification</strong><br>When this article refers to 'backdated' invoices, it means invoices that attributed services to expired contract periods (specifically, invoices submitted in 2025 that referenced September 2024 contract dates for services actually rendered in 2025). Metro Finance has indicated that the submission dates on these invoices accurately reflect when they were filed with Metro. The issue raised in this article is not about when invoices were submitted, but about the contract periods and dates referenced within them for services rendered months after the cited contract had expired.<br>Aug 24, 3:24 pm CT</p></blockquote><p>The night before, an email landed in my inbox with the subject line: <em>"OHS - obfuscating, hubris and secretive."</em> The message was blunt: "There are secrets at the Strobel house that hasn't been reported and no one at OHS wants to come out. Follow the money, sell the story and by the news."</p><p>It was one of the more cryptic messages I'd received since writing about OHS and Strobel House, Metro's first supportive housing for the chronically unhoused. Its anonymous author was a bit too selfawarely conspiratorial to appear fully credible, and I didn't quite understand what was meant by "sell the story." But its general sentiment—that there is much to be learned by <em>following the money</em>—has thus far been confirmed.</p><p>That same Thursday morning as the CoC meeting, another email arrived, unrelated to the first. It was a grievance letter from a former Strobel House employee, dated to when they were still employed. Initially written in response to perceived retaliation by a supervisor, the letter detailed alarming conditions inside Nashville's $35 million flagship homeless facility: A violent stabbing. A near suicide. Wheelchair-bound residents denied transportation. Staff retaliated against for speaking up. Workers injured by equipment they were never trained to use, then punished for taking sick leave.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png" width="727" height="201.0609375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:354,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:727,&quot;bytes&quot;:137121,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/171619020?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0PMI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2be4e-e4cc-4657-9ca7-9aa51d2bdc19_1280x354.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Some of these things I had heard of previously. In the case of the stabbing, my reporting was the first revelation that this had happened within the Metro facility—something I also discovered occurred four days into the ten-month period where Strobel House's vendor, Depaul USA, was operating without a valid contract. A predicament that only ended with the approval of a $3.5M contract on Tuesday, two days prior.</p><p>At Thursday’s CoC meeting, an anonymous question appeared on the Continuum of Care's digital feedback board that made the room go silent:</p><p>"Why have housing placements remained flat for four years while funding is 400% higher. I don't see this explained in any reports."</p><p>The meeting facilitator, a member of the CoC general membership and liaison to the Homelessness Planning Council, read it aloud and paused. "Mic drop," she said quietly.</p><p>The question hung in the air. In the room were the very officials who reported those numbers, including April Calvin, Director of Homeless Services, and members of her staff—a department that in just three years had expanded to 43 people drawing down $4.2 million annually in salaries and benefits alone. They said nothing.</p><p>Four hundred percent more money. Same number of people housed.</p><p>Inefficiency is not shocking in normal times in government. But these are far from normal times in government. Federal funding cuts to life saving resources, the same resources that some on either end of political extremes argue have propped up decades of neoliberal inequity, are being drastically cut and programmatically altered. “Housing First,” the best practice coined by Dr. Sam Tsemberis, the keynote speaker of Nashville’s 2025 State of Homelessness Symposium, is now all but <em>verboten</em> – a dissident practice like DEI or listing pronouns in email signatures.</p><p>The gathering storm, the blitzkrieg against society’s most vulnerable, is anything but subtle or hidden, but it seems <em>peculiarly invisible</em> to those who are tasked most explicitly with protecting those people. These war plans, once written in obscure missives from radical think tanks, sprang from the forehead of organizations like The American Enterprise Institute—a Koch-funded institution that continues to employ Charles Murray, whose discredited racial pseudoscience the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies as "racist," while championing the dismantling of Housing First policies in favor of civil commitment and encampment sweeps that criminalize homelessness.</p><p><strong>The Clear and Present War on the Unhoused</strong></p><p><strong>Ideology and Philosophy</strong></p><ul><li><p>Trump's homelessness <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/">Executive Orders</a> critique of housing first and any government interventions for the unhoused heavily overlap by the philosophy behind AEI's <a href="https://www.aei.org/events/good-neighbors-using-housing-data-to-reframe-homelessness/">Good Neighbors Index</a></p></li><li><p>Kevin Corinth, <a href="https://www.aei.org/profile/kevin-corinth/">AEI's homelessness expert</a>, was formerly chief economist at the <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/cea/staff/">White House Council of Economic Advisers</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.hud.gov/news/hud-no-25-092">AEI research directly influenced</a> Trump administration's 2025 reversal of HUD's PAVE policies</p></li><li><p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner <a href="https://www.hud.gov/news/hud-no-25-092">specifically referenced</a> AEI Housing Center research in press releases</p></li><li><p>The Good Neighbors Index<a href="https://www.aei.org/events/good-neighbors-using-housing-data-to-reframe-homelessness/"> ignores evidence-based practices</a> and lived experience, instead following frameworks from an institute the SPLC identifies as promoting <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2018/close-encounters-with-mainstream">"racist pseudoscience"</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Unfolding Policies</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Forced institutionalization</strong>: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-crime-and-disorder-on-americas-streets/">Civil commitment without consent</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/13/nx-s1-5500538/trump-crackdown-dc-homeless-advocates-jail">National Guard deployments</a>, jail for refusing shelter</p></li><li><p><strong>Life-saving care eliminated</strong>:<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5480445/addiction-community-responds-to-trump-homelessness-order"> Harm reduction defunded</a>, naloxone banned, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/22/g-s1-50199/doge-trump-hud-cuts-homeless-housing-programs">HUD staff cut 84%</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Healthcare destroyed</strong>: <a href="https://updates.apaservices.org/update-on-proposed-cuts-to-medicaid-funding">$1 trillion Medicaid cuts</a> targeting mental health and <a href="https://updates.apaservices.org/update-on-proposed-cuts-to-medicaid-funding">addiction services</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Housing funds frozen</strong>: <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2025/02/25/hud-staff-cuts-and-grant-delays-endanger-homelessness-services/">$3.6 billion</a> in awarded grants <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-colleagues-urge-hud-to-swiftly-distribute-36-billion-in-federal-funds-for-vital-homelessness-programs">withheld from communities</a></p></li><li><p><strong>800+ National Guard troops</strong> now <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/11/nx-s1-5497749/dc-trump-crackdown-crime">sweep DC homeless camps</a> in camouflage fatigues—<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/national-guard-washington-crackdown-trump-1.7611055">Trump calls this a "template" for other cities</a></p></li></ul><p>An attendee Thursday morning expressed the latent tension in the room: "If your agency isn't figuring out how to deal with these political issues, you should be challenging them and connecting with other agencies.

The e-vite, which was sent out by OHS, contained the debatably passive aggressive parenthetical “Depaul  also extends its sincerest apologies for the delay in sending this invitation.” The send date of the invitation, while not punctual, was much more on time than the renewal of Depaul’s contract, which was up for consideration by Council that same night — a full 10 months after their contract had expired.</p><p>On Monday and Tuesday night, Director Calvin had been grilled by various Metro Council Committees about what seemed to be a scheme to backdate over $500k of invoices for the out-of-contract provider running Strobel. A typically chipper person with a rosy perspective on even the most dire metrics, her responses had been uncharacteristically scripted and unenthused.  </p><p>The extraordinary fiscal controversy was not mentioned at the Strobel celebrations, however. Nor were any of the allegations filling my inbox, nor explicit mentions of any recent fire causing extensive damage to facilities. On a tour of the facility, we were told we would be visiting the <em>first</em> and <em>third</em> floor.</p><p>"What's going on with the second floor?" I asked immediately. </p><p>There was a brief pause from our tour guide, then a quick explanation. "There's water damage, they're redoing the floors."</p><p>I asked a few more questions and learned that there had indeed been a fire, purportedly started in a resident's kitchen. It had set off the sprinklers on the second floor and caused significant damage. Thinking of the residents in wheelchairs who had greeted me on entering the facility, I asked “are all the residents in wheelchairs on the first floor?” </p><p>“No, every floor is handicap accessible,” I was told with pride.</p><p>I looked to the wide, polished elevators, and considered that universal admonishment they declare: “Do not use in case of fire”.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>"We learned a lot this first year,"</strong> Director Calvin said in her remarks before Mayor O'Connell spoke. The politicians all thanked each other for being there. There was much love given to the family of the namesake of the facility, the late Charlie Strobel, the humanitarian who founded Room in the Inn. Success stories of residents were shared, similar to those that appeared on an Instagram post by OHS (timed to coincide with the event).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png" width="1456" height="1282" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1282,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1707808,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/171619020?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bACz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ea83de5-9877-4dd6-9932-e00b63eb1902_1910x1682.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The tours I had with residents showed clean, dorm-style private rooms. They were orders of magnitudes more modern than the literal Civil War morgue I spent my freshman year in, though perhaps sterile in a podiatrist’s office type way. The few life stories shared with me were touching and affirming. I had to resist the urge to network, uncontrollably brainstorming where their various crafting projects could be exhibited — I know enough to leave this to case managers to manage.</p><p>I’ve worked in media relations for a non-profit serving returning citizens (from jail or prison) and know intimately the superposition, the duality contained in the self reflections that are captured by NGOs of their clients. I was responsible for helping clients narrative their success stories in ways that aligned more with our city funder’s priorities than their own emotional journeys. Synergy was always desirable, but it was never a question that any complex feelings about our organization would end up on the cutting room floor. </p><p>I know first hand that if you live a hard enough life, a service environment can be <em>both</em> the best thing that ever happened to you, and, like the organization I worked for in New Jersey, extraordinarily toxic. Non-profits, to a truly extraordinary degree that no longer feels ironic to me, have a habit of treating their staff inhumanely, and their clientele as what they, in point of fact, are: <em>the product</em>. </p><p>The <s>CEO<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></s> Executive Director of Depaul USA, the organization at the heart of the half million dollars of backdated invoices, had nothing but glowing things to say about working with Nashville. He announced in vague terms some additional services that would be made available for residents in the near future—all of which sounded very much in scope of their (finally executed) contract. He bragged about how much of the staff, in a way that seemed beyond belief to him, knew by name all 90 residents. The ED of the non-profit that <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/352338110/202423209349317037/full">employs around 120</a> people does not know, he professed, the names of 90 people in his life. </p><p>Earlier in the event, the Mayor engaged in the perfunctory mutual delusion we partake in, telling the story of several residents as if these are people he just happens to know. Depaul’s ED took a page from this book, perhaps impromptu, and relayed what the resident he spoke to that morning told him: "He said: ‘It's better than HBO. I mean all the stories you get in here.’"</p><p>It was one of those public events where you know 80% of the people hate each other's guts (I know I was a very unwelcome guest), 10% are thrilled to be there, and the rest are checking their phones waiting to get off the clock. It was an event, mundane and perfunctory, that seems to emerge pre-formed from the ether of local politics. A necessary side effect of allocating lots of capital to create large things. Group photos were taken and Roscoe’s did the catering.</p><p>And all so entirely, uncannily, disconnected from what is happening under the surface.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The story of Nashville's homelessness system</strong>—and the conspicuous profiteering that has cropped up around it since COVID-19 flooded this anemic system at the beginning of this decade—is like ducks on water.</p><p>It’s actors are friendly and placid, if a tad goofy. But under the surface: chaos. The frantic paddling in a river rushing ever forward. I've spent the last few months in this water, getting to know its currents and creatures. Its surface covered with bureaucrats and politicians, waterfowl all intent on appearing calm, collected, conscientious—ignorant (or pretending to be) that the waterway they're carried on has been carved out by forces far greater than them. The waters rerouted to flood fields on private land. The small fish they live upon washed onto the shores, mulched into the fields of someone else's plan for them. And the silly little ducks paddle right up on the land, happy to find a dry spot with grass to feast upon. Unaware that they are next up for the net.</p><p>Forgetting that they could just tell the truth, and fly away.</p><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.
