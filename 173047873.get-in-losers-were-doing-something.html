<p>I have this funny feeling that we are moving through a period where our civic leaders, across the political spectrum, on topics like <em>housing as a human right</em>, are going to require hearing our critical and passionate feedback.</p><p>The exploitative extraction of rents, especially on shelter, is a thing people like me tend to get animated about. "Passionate" you might say.</p><p>I've heard "passion" used in elite circles to describe a certain kind of feedback, contrasted with people who are "reasonable." The overwhelmingly white (and vast majority male) people I've heard make this distinction reserve this term disproportionately for women and minorities. "It's very important for people to be passionate," you get as a polite aside, "but it's not a solid place to make decisions from."</p><p>As a white guy who has formally studied logic and spent 20 years in therapy working to better experience and express my emotions, I feel qualified to say that pulling apart emotions and reason is stupid, dangerous, and deeply undemocratic.</p><p>It's also just… such white people bullshit.</p><h2>Philosophy | φιλοσοφία | The Love of Wisdom</h2><p>The relationship between reason and emotion is co-constitutive—they cannot exist without each other. True reason is anything but the cold, calculating market logic we see in the consulting class shaping our society. Emotions are sources of knowledge. In fact, they make knowledge possible. The hallucination problem with AI comes from LLMs having no embodied experience to ground their outputs—no ability to feel that something is true or not. Human systems that dedicate themselves to "pure reason" and intentionally exclude lived experience aren't building rational machines—they're building machines that cannot learn.</p><p>It's always a bad faith project to divorce emotions from decision making, because it's never actually all emotions that are banned. In any space that values pure rationality, you find screaming egotists running the show, or else simmering fury behind the eyes of people trying their best to keep their cool.</p><p>What gets called "reason" is often ego-bound calculation—the isolated thinking subject making decisions from narrow self-interest. Despite claiming to be "unemotional," its practitioners are usually quick to anger, deeply thin-skinned, and prone to grudges.</p><p>The devotion to "reasonableness" is never that rare, deep cut liberal arts infatuation with the divine logic at the universe's core. Usually when people are praised as "reasonable", this is liberalism's crude uplifting of people who don't cause headaches, people who say yes and never "why?", people who either are too pot committed to let their conscience stop their actions, or who never had much of one to begin with.</p><p>Emotions, when allowed to be fully expressed, are inherently expansive: empathy dissolves the boundary between self and other, love expands our circle of concern, anger at injustice connects us to collective suffering. And including collective suffering into political decision making adds variables they'd rather not deal with.</p><h2>Agapē tou plēsion | ἀγάπη τοῦ πλησίον | Divine Love of Neighbor</h2><p>When emotion and reason truly cross-pollinate, the synthesis is that elusive, antiquated, dangerous thing we hoped we could get rid of: wisdom.</p><p>Our world does not end. Rather, we experience a profound recursive loop where rational clarity is informed by expanded awareness that includes the wellbeing of others. Wisdom notices: Yes, this argument is logically airtight within my narrow frame, but what other rational arguments emerge when I expand the sphere of whom I must consider?</p><p>Jesus' pronouncement of the two commandments—love God with all your heart, soul and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself—puts this in context. World traditions throughout time advised followers to dedicate themselves to contemplation of the divine. But the second commandment is more unusual. He uses the term agape, not philos as in friend or eros as in lover, but agape, the sanctified love describing transcendence, the psychadelic-adjacent dissolution and expansion of the self.</p><p>What lies at the intersection of reason and emotion is transcendent wisdom. And we can only get that when we integrate logic and genuine human experience.</p><p>Wisdom is always born from the soil of a specific moment, shaped by the pressures, patterns, and accidents of its time. And yet, once it emerges, it carries a form that other minds—standing in utterly different places—can still recognize as true everywhere, forever.</p><p>But we're not building human systems that value the unfolding of wisdom. We are not designing societies capable of listening.</p><p>When we build systems that preference "the reason of the market" over emotion, but this does not produce systems that are in anyway <em>reasonable</em>. In ancient Greece, the Sophists were professional rhetoricians who sold their skills to the highest bidder, training elites to make any argument sound rational regardless of its truth or justice. The Sophists' degraded reason, cut off from experiential wisdom, made arguments that sounded logical but served only power.</p><h2>Sophists | Σοφισταί | Pretenders to Wisdom</h2><p>Today's consulting class operates as modern Sophists. They promise to remove emotions from decision-making while allowing the unprocessed emotions of those seeking power to masquerade as rationality.</p><p>There is, increasingly, a priesthood operating in the open, DOGE-ing their way through our society, more concerned with their personal credit card reward points than the systems that collapse in their wake. The goal is to disempower the people who, as Nobel Prize winner Eleanor Ostrom said, are most qualified to make decisions: the ones most invested in getting it right.</p><p>The sophistry flows from both directions. Cities hire "neutral" consultants to craft housing strategies that align with their preconceived political whims, while real estate developers deploy lobbying firms presenting themselves as merely "educating" leaders about market realities. With the same lobbyists providing sophistical support on how to stay in power, there is little space left to discern what is true.</p><p>And despite all this <em>rational self interest, </em>we don't actually end up with systems free of emotions. Instead, we build systems that systematically discredit emotions tied to what Abraham Maslow called "Being Values", transcendent themes like Justice, Fairness, and Truth. But allow behind the scenes the simmering logic of Maslow's "deficiency values" are given free reign, with personal grievance, bigotry, power hoarding, unprocessed traumas, all transmuted into "rational" public policy.</p><p>Modern sophistry knows no political boundaries. Whether it's conservative ideologues at the Heritage Foundation or "progressivist" Richard Florida-style "Abundance" capitalism that says the problem isn't exploitation of people's fundamental needs, but friction preventing the creative class from unleashing their values.</p><p>Whether right-wing deregulation—"let the market work"—or left-wing "abundance" advocates calling for supply-side reforms, both systematically exclude the people who are actually unhoused from decision-making. Both treat housing as a commodity to be optimized rather than as a human right to be democratically controlled.</p><p>Nashville provides a perfect case study. Both approaches accelerate construction of high-end units while displacing long-term residents and handing decision-making power to speculative capital—Airbnb conversions, corporate landlords, out-of-state developers—rather than to people whose lives depend on stable, affordable homes. Neither plan has meaningful solutions for those making 0-30% of area median income.</p><p>In Plato's dialogue Meno, Socrates demonstrates that class and education aren't requirements to access divine wisdom. Through patient dialogue, an unnamed slave boy produces the proof of the Pythagorean theorem with no training in logic. The takeaway: all people contain divine, transcendent logic within them, and virtue needs to be "recollected"—remembered.</p><p>Socrates spent his life exposing mercenary rhetoricians, revealing how the strongest arguments were just the most well-funded. He called himself the gadfly of the state—the insect persistent enough to pierce the flesh of a horse. The state, this great experiment in democracy, was prone to falling asleep, and in that slumber, great predators arose.</p><h2>The New Athens</h2><p>Nashville, the "Athens of the South," has a complex relationship to federal authoritarian threats, with local leadership making private concessions under the delusion that appeasement has ever stopped a tyrant. Locally, oligarchs have long had their will done—though they perhaps have found a powerful new tool through a "truly progressive" leader that sleeping liberals assume is working in their best interest.</p><p>Take Nashville's housing strategy, which opens by framing the crisis not as human suffering but as "$8.42 billion in lost economic output"—exactly the kind of cold market logic that masquerades as reason while serving power. The strategy calls for 90,000 new homes but only targets 20,000 for working families, while those in deepest need remain locked out by state laws that prohibit local affordability requirements.</p><p>Notice what's missing: no appeals to the transcendent values of Justice, Human Dignity, Truth. The market logic presented simply cannot solve the problem because the problem is caused by the very logic that drives these markets. We have to ground our solutions in transcendent principles like human dignity precisely because the logic of the marketplace has no module to engage with this.</p><p>As Audre Lorde knew, the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. When our leaders cannot imagine how we could help people sleep inside without figuring out how this could be done profitably, these are not the people who will bring about the change we need—because they cannot imagine a world where no one gets to profit off of someone having shelter.</p><p>But this being the new Athens, a new generation of awake, educated, emotionally intelligent AND highly rational resistance is being midwifed. We are capable of seeing through Left/Right culture war illusions, and we see the conflict for what it is: democracy versus tyranny. And whether it is tyranny from Washington or tyranny from Downtown, we are the gadflies who've come to wake you up.</p><p>Buzz buzz, motherfuckers.</p>
