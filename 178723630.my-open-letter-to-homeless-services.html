There were many passionate statements made in today’s meeting about the importance of us all seeing every angle on these things and being in this together. Dede Byrd and I, for example, come from very different perspectives, but we have found much unity in the importance of transparency and oversight to get the best long-term outcomes for us all.</p><p>Please note that I have BCC’d Metro Council on this communication.</p><p>I spoke briefly to Allison about this today, but as this program, Metro Rapid Relief Funds (MRRF) (in the FY26 budget book as “non-traditional rapid rehousing”) comes into shape, I am going to provide you some boundaries that I believe will help it be implemented effectively.</p><p>As I mentioned in my public comments, I believe that dedicated funding from the city to help rehouse people is a very good thing. If it is well implemented, I will actually enthusiastically endorse it and give you all the credit for it. MRRF must, however, come with clear processes, contracts, prioritization methodology and oversight mechanisms so that it does not become in essence a slush fund that is used to close encampments just because a Metro Council Member or other political entity says this is what they want. A framework with this type of robust methodology has not yet been made public.</p><p>These funds need to be used, I think we can all agree, to help our most vulnerable access long-term housing options. And that does not look like placing someone into an apartment under a lease in their own name, requiring them to somehow find something like $1,400 [a month for rent] that they do not have, and leaving it to service providers to cover their rent and/or find them a new place to live, all things they were not contracted to do. I know you haven’t read recent articles, but if it is required for me to cite specific circumstances where this has happened, I have the documentation required to demonstrate that this has in fact happened. Many times.</p><p>But I am not interested in overly litigating what has happened in the past, but rather in providing the structure wherein this is less likely to happen in the future.</p><h2>To this end, please note these three things:</h2><p><strong>1. The community will be tracking very closely through public records requests all allocations that come out of the business unit associated in the Metro Budget for “non-traditional rapid rehousing.”</strong></p><p>These are public funds being used for public purposes by public servants. Please be very aware: every cent that is spent in every government agency is subject to public records request. The laws in Tennessee require more transparency than almost anywhere. We have previously been willing to seek recourse with the Tennessee State Comptroller before for OHS lack of furnishing documents promptly, and we will do so in the future if necessary.</p><p>What’s more, I am proactively requesting 100% of Metro general budget expenditures from Metro Finance on a rolling basis, so OHS will not be involved in the acquisition of these records in the future.</p><p>So please, ensure your finance staff, and anyone on Council or otherwise who may want to access these funds for their own ends, is aware that everything they are doing will be looked at by watchdogs like me and if needed publicized broadly if it does not seem to align with actual best practices for serving the unhoused.</p><p>I know you make frequent reference to out-of-state agencies who affirm all of your office’s activities align with best practices. Respectfully, our city also has people who are experts on homelessness, and they, unlike out-of-state consultants, vote in local elections, and don’t get to fly back to another city after they collect their generous consulting fees.</p><p>As the Nobel Prize Winner Elinor Ostrom said: <em>“There is no reason to believe that bureaucrats and politicians, no matter how well meaning, are better at solving problems than the people on the spot, who have the strongest incentive to get the solution right.”</em></p><p><strong>2. Any Encampment Prioritization Committee meetings (or any other groups that purport to represent the HPC that are involved in encampment closures) that are not publicly noticed will be filed with the Metro Ethical Conduct Board.</strong></p><p>The Ethical Conduct Board does not take submissions for groups but only for individuals, so anyone who is currently in those meetings should be prepared to receive an ethics board investigation if these meetings are not publicly noticed.</p><p>Not only is this a legal requirement under TOMA, but it is in full alignment with the USICH’s “19 Strategies for Communities to Address Encampments Humanely and Effectively.” Its #1 strategy reads: <em>“It is critical to connect early, often, transparently, and meaningfully with encampment residents who understand better than any other people which services and outreach approaches work—and which do not. Engaging and including people living in encampments in policymaking, planning, and nearly every strategy of this guidance increases their likelihood of receiving the housing, health, and other support necessary to move off the streets and into housing or shelter while they await permanent housing. It is also critical to fairly compensate people who have experienced homelessness for their time and expertise.”</em></p><p>The preference for these meetings to be secret is duly noted. I know that per Nashville.gov your office has stated: <em>“We do not discuss when a camp is identified prior to notifying the people in the camp.”</em> Unfortunately, this neither aligns with best practices nor the Tennessee Open Meetings Act, and for the professional reputation of those who are involved in this decision making, it is advisable that you cease holding these meetings privately immediately. But if ethics complaint filings and public admonishments are required, we will pursue that route.</p><p><strong>3. Eviction rates are now being tracked.</strong></p><p>We are obtaining eviction proceedings information directly from its source, not from case managers or self-reports of clients. This is an extraordinarily important metric to track, though to my knowledge it is not something OHS has been explicitly monitoring. Tracking evictions is actually a very efficient way to know who may be facing homelessness.</p><p>If your office would like to have access to this data set which is updated on a daily basis and is far more searchable than the normal public portal, please let me know. There is a very easy way to search names in bulk and to see if anyone you’ve placed in housing has been evicted since they were placed.</p><p>We are in the process of verifying how many recipients of Landlord Engagement Funds were evicted thereafter. I will only publish this once there is robust verification that these evictions took place after landlord engagement funds. This is not to shame OHS and the service providers who were assigned to these clients. We are not looking for perfection, but we are looking for a baseline that the city can improve from.</p><p>I brought this up to Allison today because I want your office to be very clear that this is being monitored, and this may impact the way success is being viewed for MRRF. If the metric we are judging our collective housing system by is merely “housing placements,” we are missing any sort of picture of the efficacy of our efforts. If someone is placed into housing they cannot afford out of direct engagement with Metro Nashville and/or a service provider, and then they get an eviction and a judgment on their record with the balance of that judgment being garnished from their wages (with interest) we need to know that is not necessarily a net positive result for that person. Once they are evicted they are once again unhoused, but now with a recent eviction and far less income because they signed a lease that they would not have qualified for if not for things like landlord engagement funds.</p><div><hr></div><p>I am not providing you these parameters to set you to fail. I am giving you these so you have the constraints with which you can succeed.</p><p>As I told Allison today, I do believe we all want what is best for the unhoused in our community. However, it is extraordinarily important that proper process be followed and transparency be provided if this is to happen with public resources. There is nothing preventing directors of private non-profits from using funds how they wish. But as a public employee, you have limits to how you use money. I am sorry if Metro did not make this clear to you prior to taking this position, and if they did not, then they set you up to fail.</p><p>You made comments today, and submitted previously in writing, about how these are not HUD-funding monies and therefore are not subject to oversight by the HPC. That is a fair point (though it tees up a conversation about whether OHS makes sense as the Coordinated Entry (CE)-lead as it demonstrates a fundamental lack of faith in its model. It also ignores the fact that as CE-lead, its effectiveness is actually your responsibility as the leader of OHS).</p><p>But regardless, these MRRF funds are still taxpayer dollars, and are therefore, as per the Tennessee Open Records Act, subject to as much scrutiny as the public wishes to place upon them. And because of the past revelations of your Office’s stewardship of taxpayer money, I want to make this unambiguous: there will be a very high amount of attention paid to how these funds are spent and who benefits from them.</p><p>Your comments today and prior emails indicated that these funds will “offer relief” to “Metro Departments and Council Members.” This is a strange way of framing for whom these funds are meant to benefit. I want it to be clear to Metro Departments and Council Members alike that they should expect community oversight on how these funds are used, even if it is not performed through formal channels, and Council Members and Department heads should expect this to be a topic of conversation at committee meetings, council meetings, and polling places.</p><p>I want to make this extremely clear: these funds are not “OHS’s money” or “Mayor O’Connell’s money.” This is the public’s money. We are entrusting you both with it to do what is in our community’s best interest. Not what a Council Member wants. Not what the tourism board wants. Not what Tom Turner wants.</p><p>And let me make the implicit explicit: we have gained a vast amount of collective political power in exposing the financial irregularities of OHS, and combined with other ways in which this administration is not following through on promises to help our most vulnerable, there is a snowballing coalition of people who have had enough. Every time the Mayor’s Office, and his direct appointees such as yourself, demonstrate a desire to act autonomously, without transparency, and in contravention to the very best practices you claim to operate under, you make us more powerful.</p><p>If you want to help the Mayor’s agenda succeed and enhance his legacy, you need to conform to the expectations of a public servant immediately. If you want to add fuel to the fire of those who are increasingly disappointed in his follow-through on his campaign promises, your office should continue to behave as it has been doing.</p><p>Please, I beg you, prove me wrong.</p><p>Yours in creative constraints,</p><p>Mike Lacy</p>
