I was hoping they could help dispel my concerns that what is happening here is extremely alarming. Instead, they confirmed my alarm, and in fact, they offered to let me write an article for a national audience on the topic. </p><p><strong>The <a href="https://truthout.org/awards/">award winning</a> <a href="https://truthout.org/about/">Truthout.org</a> edited, fact checked, and published my findings in <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/a-nashville-proposal-could-outsource-surveillance-and-policing-to-a-nonprofit/">an article they published</a> yesterday.</strong></p><p>I was honored to share a byline with the highly respected surveillance researcher and reporter Ed Vogel. He helped add national context to this reporting and reached out to local entities on behalf of Truthout to get their side of the story in the event that they wouldn’t want to talk to me.<br></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://truthout.org/articles/a-nashville-proposal-could-outsource-surveillance-and-policing-to-a-nonprofit/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Read on Truthout&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://truthout.org/articles/a-nashville-proposal-could-outsource-surveillance-and-policing-to-a-nonprofit/"><span>Read on Truthout</span></a></p><p><br>This article contains fully vetted and fact checked information. </p><p><strong>But there are things that could not be verified in this reporting process.</strong></p><p>For example: The O’Connell administration and Nashville Downtown Partnership claim the state grant has already been awarded to NDP, and frame this resolution as merely adding “limits” on fund usage—and not as a requirement for obtaining the grant. This was not able to be verified or disproven.</p><p>However, the MOU and resolution language appear to contradict this. The resolution states that the attached document is “part of the application to the State of Tennessee, Office of Criminal Justice Programs.” And while the MOU language does require NDP to “Ensure all expenditures of funds from the DPSG grant appear on the list provided in Exhibit A”— it’s unclear whether this serves to limit NDP’s purchases or <em>obligates</em> NDP to purchase the listed items on behalf of Metro. Notably, the language of the MOU in no way resembles what “unallowable expenses” language typically looks like in contracts. As an example, one can look to the state grant solicitation attached to the MOU (see footnote) which explicitly details unallowable expenses.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>Verifying these competing claims would require examining the actual grant application and any award letter—documents that have not been made publicly available. Neither the Mayor’s Office nor NDP provided these documents or responded to Truthout’s requests for comment.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://truthout.org/articles/a-nashville-proposal-could-outsource-surveillance-and-policing-to-a-nonprofit/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Read on Truthout&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://truthout.org/articles/a-nashville-proposal-could-outsource-surveillance-and-policing-to-a-nonprofit/"><span>Read on Truthout</span></a></p><p></p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p><p>A lobbyist for the Nashville Downtown Partnership has sent a communication to some Council Members that appears to confirm that some of this technology is indeed a form of surveillance technology. Unlike other elements of the MOU, he is asserting that these two tools would require specific approval by Metro Council to be implemented. He does not explicitly state why this is the case, but this aligns with <a href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/p/new-surveillance-tech-requires-a">what I published yesterday</a> about these two line items in the MOU.</p><blockquote><p>The only new technology contemplated in this agreement are Leosight and Fivecast, described as situational awareness tools that will be integrated into the community safety center. It is important to note that both of those pieces of software would require separate Council approval before implementation. This money is not being used to expand the scope of MNPD services or purchase much discussed technology platforms including LPRs or FUSUS.</p></blockquote><p><strong>However, since these tools are indeed are clearly definable as “surveillance technology,” then this MOU resolution would likely need a public hearing to be passed.</strong></p><p>The regulation about public hearings (see footnote)<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> is not limited to the actual contract for services, but includes legislation that takes the form of: “(3) Accepting state or federal funds or in-kind or other donations for surveillance technology.” If this MOU is obligating NDP to purchase these things on behalf of Metro and provide them to Metro, then this MOU would likely require a public hearing to be passed. This may give some context as to why this is being framed as a “oversight” resolution, rather than a document that is detailing how NDP will purchase things for Metro.</p><p>However, the lobbyist for NDP has made it explicit that their understanding of the arrangement being discussed in this MOU that “gifts” will be provided to Metro purchased by NDP from the grant. If any of these “gifts” detailed in the MOU are definable as “surveillance technology”, this would require a public hearing.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png" width="1446" height="236" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:236,&quot;width&quot;:1446,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:279270,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/i/180481712?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8NIR!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac413af1-aa18-4eec-b254-276ccb59511c_1446x236.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><p><strong>Here’s other coverage on the topic:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>News Channel 5:</strong> <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/safety-or-surveillance-15m-downtown-nashville-plan-sparks-debate">Safety or surveillance? $15M downtown Nashville plan sparks debate</a></p></li><li><p><strong>WKRN:</strong> <a href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/nashville/15m-grant-surveillance-tech/">Downtown Nashville could see new surveillance tech after $15M state grant</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Nashville Banner:</strong> <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/12/01/nashville-downtown-partnership-fusus-tennessee-grant/">Mayor’s Office Quietly Files Resolution to Allow Surveillance Use by Downtown Partnership</a></p></li><li><p><strong>CityCast Nashville:</strong> <a href="https://nashville.citycast.fm/podcasts/tn-07-results-plus-is-downtown-getting-mass-surveillance">TN-07 Results!
