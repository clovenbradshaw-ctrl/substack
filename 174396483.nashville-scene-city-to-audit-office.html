<p><strong>Thank you to the many who took up the call to reach out about the audit request into the Office of Homeless Services. It seems like it worked.</strong></p><p>Yesterday the Internal Audit Committee weighed the proposal, and attached were dozens of email submissions from invested community members who supported this bare minimum of oversight. They voted unanimously that a financial audit was warranted.</p><div><hr></div><p>This work is only possible through your support. Consider joining with me and becoming a <strong>“MuniciPal”</strong> today. (I worked too long on that pun to not get at least a couple takers on this offer).</p><p class="button-wrapper"

The housing placement changes in 2020-2021 show that <em>there is a way money can translate into more housing placements –</em> but that’s not what we’ve been doing since 2021.</p><p>The only correlation between increased funding and measurable outcomes is the rising number of encampment removals. This creates a troubling paradox: either these displaced individuals aren’t being housed at all (given that permanent housing placements remain flat), or they’re jumping the queue ahead of those who’ve been patiently waiting for housing while avoiding encampments. If it’s the latter, we’ve created a perverse incentive structure where living in an encampment becomes a strategic advantage—a fast track to housing that rewards visible crisis over quiet desperation. This well-documented phenomenon essentially tells vulnerable people: make your suffering more visible, more disruptive, more politically inconvenient, and you’ll be prioritized. It’s a system that inadvertently encourages people to deteriorate into encampments rather than seek help before reaching that point.</p><p></p><p>All of this is <em>very complicated</em>, and it is why any well functioning homelessness system requires autonomy from political institutions like, for example, a Mayor’s Office. And this is why a well functioning homelessness system (and really any system) requires genuine oversight from “small d” democratic institutions which are overseen by those with the greatest incentives to get things <em>right. </em>They require oversight by people who are not not incentivized quick wins that the general public or business interests want to see — but in <em>actually doing the work.</em></p><p>What’s important about what happened yesterday is that it is an example of democratic checks and balances at work — <strong>something we all desperately need to see examples of.</strong></p><p>I breathed a deep sigh of relief when the voting was totaled. The MuniciPals needed a win (we’re gonna make MuniciPals happen! No one’s allowed to co-opt it either!)</p><p>It’s pretty simple. When it comes to OHS, the public has had concerns about how public funds are being used by a particular public institution. The public, the source of all power in all societies (no matter what form of governance is forced upon them), said:</p><p><em>“Hey, this looks kinda weird. Could someone take a closer look at this and get back to us?”</em></p><p>And the system, as it seems to rarely do these days, <em>listened</em>.</p><p>Cramped into a small committee chamber, with attendance overflowing into another room, people spoke yesterday in favor of, and opposed to, an audit of the Office of Homeless Services.</p><div id="youtube2-vsGlPI9B0DE" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;vsGlPI9B0DE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vsGlPI9B0DE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Amongst those speaking against putting a magnifying glass on how public money is spent was Allison Cantway, Assistant Director of Planning and Research for the Office of Homeless Services. OHS is, in her words,<em> “an open book.”</em></p><p>Also speaking against the audit were a variety of residents of Strobel House and the Rodeway Inn, recently unhoused people with inspiring stories of change and redemption which they credited to the Office of Homeless Services.</p><p>Their personal stories were moving and important to be shared. But it was hard to tell what connection their stories had to the specific financial irregularities at the heart of this inquiry, and why they had been asked to share their personal stories at a recorded, public record at an oversight hearing.</p><p>It was all a bit… weird. OHS’s reaction to the potential audit boiled down to: “Everything is fine. We’re an open book! But also, please don’t look at our books. Instead, look at these individuals we’ve helped!”</p><p>The individual stories stories of OHS helping individuals overcome the odds of chronic homelessness seemed to be used in lieu of actual metrics of the Office improving the rates of people moving in permanent housing because, as I mentioned, there has not been an improvement in these raw figures of housing placements since before OHS founding.</p><p>It was a more nuanced defense than Director Calvin made in the first lines of her opening remarks at the Homelessness Symposium this year, referring to things I had written, and articles by the Nashville Scene and The Nashville Banner critical of her office, with the unambiguously Trumpian epithet <em>“Fake News.”</em></p><p>The Audit Committee, quite respectfully, did not take the bait. The Office of the Internal Audit will be assigning staff looking into the financial aspects of the request for audit, and will provide updates to the committee.</p><p>The question now is whether Mayor Freddie O’Connell will act. It should be remembered that, through a<a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/p/nashvilles-homeless-services-faces"> late-filed amendment during OHS’s creation</a>, then Councilmember O’Connell concentrated oversight power in the Mayor’s Office, stripping it from the Homelessness Planning Council and giving The Mayor’s Office sole authority to hire or fire the Director. That makes him the only person who can demand real change at OHS—if he chooses to.</p><p>Now that even his Director of Finance has agreed that an audit of this office—an office O’Connell created as a Councilmember and now directly oversees as Mayor—is warranted, the message is unmistakable: there <em>is</em> something to look at here. Will O’Connell, as advocates have been asking of him for <em>years now</em>, finally examine what’s going on at OHS?</p><div class="pullquote"><p>As Dr. Freyd describes it, “victims, perpetrators, and witnesses may display betrayal blindness in order to preserve relationships, institutions, and social systems upon which they depend.” We literally cannot see the harm being done because acknowledging it would threaten our survival or our fundamental belief in the systems we depend on.</p></div><h3>What type of book did you say?</h3><p>I definitely had a part in this audit taking place. But I can do nothing without people like you reaching out to Councilmembers and the Internal Auditor’s Office and the Mayor’s Office and voicing <em>your opinion</em>. </p><p>I will be very mad if any of you said: “Mike Lacy said XYZ is a problem so I’m here to complain about it!” Not the vibe! I ain’t no authority on nothing except Tom Cruise trivia.</p><p>I hope you said something more like: “This primary source document [Mike Lacy found] seems to be problematic. Can this be looked into?!” And honestly, not mentioning my name will get you much further these days.</p><p>But how did we get here?</p><p>After being appraised of some concerning practices by OHS, I started requesting financial documents. People say it in movies a lot, and a few people have said it to me in real life (always with a weird look in their eyes), but now I’m saying it to you because honestly nothing has ever proven more true: Follow the money.</p><p>When this all started, I sent in some perfunctory Public Records Requests to start to figure out what’s what. And it quickly got weird.</p><p>My first red flag was not what I received, but what I did not receive: anything. No response to my request for documents, despite TN state law requiring that within 7 days. And no response to my “hey, I never got a response.” And no response to my in-person “hey, could you tell [redacted] that they need to respond to my request?”</p><div

How the money being used is <em>public money.</em> How the information about how that money being used <em>is not proprietary, </em>and how if anyone asks you for that info <em>you have to give it to them.</em> </p><p>There are places where you can work and spend money and not tell people what you did with it.</p><p>The government is actually kind of <em>the one place</em> you can never do that.</p><div><hr></div><p></p><p><strong>Yesterday,</strong> the Internal Audit Committee demonstrated what those opposing the audit could not: the ability to hold multiple truths simultaneously. Yes, OHS helps some people. But that doesn’t erase the documented $500,000+ in improper payments to Depaul USA, nor excuse the fact that despite ballooning budgets since 2020, housing placements remain flat.</p><p>The audit opposition’s logic was troubling. They paraded success stories as if individual victories could somehow nullify financial irregularities. The implication? Anyone questioning OHS must want the unhoused to suffer. This weaponized the gratitude of vulnerable residents, turning them into human shields against financial scrutiny.</p><p>Meanwhile, OHS claims to be an “open book” while fighting transparency, dismisses documented evidence as “fake news,” and portrays Council Member Ginny Welsch as a persecutor rather than someone doing basic oversight. </p><p>Psychologist Jennifer Freyd has a term for this: “institutional betrayal”—when organizations we depend on violate our trust. It’s more destabilizing than individual harm because it shatters faith in systems themselves. Freyd also identified the defense mechanism institutions use: DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender). Deny wrongdoing, attack questioners, then play victim.</p><p>But you won’t catch anyone admitting that this is what’s going on. </p><p>These are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brothers-sisters-strangers/202312/betrayal-blindness-not-seeing-whats-obvious">unconscious scripts</a> that play out, with people blind either to the fictionality of betrayal narratives they are manifesting to avoid their own accountability, or the reality they are suppressing because the institutions they’ve built up and supported have failed themselves and others.</p><p>These are the dances of illusion, what India’s Advaita Vedanta calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)">Maya</a>, where the veils we weave become the bars of our self-made prisons. In one movement, we choreograph elaborate betrayal narratives, casting ourselves as the wounded protagonist to sidestep the mirror of our own complicity. In another, we perform the ritual of unseeing, our eyes carefully trained away from the cracks in the very foundations we’ve spent lifetimes mortaring with our faith, our labor, our identity.</p><p>As Dr. Freyd describes it, “victims, perpetrators, and witnesses may display betrayal blindness in order to preserve relationships, institutions, and social systems upon which they depend.” <strong>We literally cannot see the harm being done because acknowledging it would threaten our survival or our fundamental belief in the systems we depend on.</strong></p><p>No financial audit can fix these types of problems. These are psychosocial problems whose terrain belongs more to clergy than accountants. But we can exert <em>boundaries.</em> We can say: these behaviors, this way of using our collective resources, is unacceptable. And if inside those boundaries we set our leaders choose to either retreat into more illusion, or, as we ask of our unhoused neighbors every day, we ask our leaders to do the hard, internal work that will allow them to <em>rise to the occasion — </em>that is between them and their God(s). </p><p>OHS is supposed to be our safety net. When that safety net fights accountability, it betrays not just current clients but all of us who might need these services someday.</p><p>The antidote, Freyd argues, to “institutional betrayal” is <strong>“institutional courage”</strong>—seeking truth despite unpleasantness, risk, and cost. Yesterday’s unanimous audit vote was exactly that. The question now: Will OHS leadership—and Mayor O’Connell, who directly oversees them—demonstrate the same courage? <strong>Or will they continue confusing accountability with attack?</strong></p><p>As Freyd notes, you don’t need evil intentions to cause institutional harm. Good people can perpetuate bad systems. The test isn’t whether Director Calvin means well. It’s whether she has the courage to welcome the scrutiny that comes with managing public trust and public funds, serving the most vulnerable people (which requires an even higher threshold of accountability). And if she does not, does Mayor O’Connell have the courage to hire someone who does?</p><p></p><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.
