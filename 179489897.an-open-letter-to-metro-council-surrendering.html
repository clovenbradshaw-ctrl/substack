Even the most self-destructive bureaucrats tend to know not to put these things in writing, so it is often hard to bring documentary evidence of these actions. But I do have my own story about it. And I hope that by sharing it, others will be willing to come forward.</p><p>I have been waiting to do this. I’m doing it now, not out of desperation or vindictiveness, but because I think <em>the timing is right.</em><br><br>I have many faults, among them poor proofræding, bluntness, and habitually getting oil stains on nice pants. But a talent I do have is cultural and political <em>taste</em>—an aptitude for knowing which way the wind is blowing socially. I am not a political savant or soothsayer. I’ve merely done the internal work to be able to hear signals from humans across the social and political spectrum, and I have good pattern recognition skills.</p><p>For my bona fides, I’d like to point you to public comments I made in February 2024.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;f987b39f-903d-43d1-b70f-0195895e7874&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>Damn, that was a good hair day.</p><p>In these comments I gave you back in 2024, I warned about three progressive programs being derailed, the dissolution of the Office of Community Safety, unpaid community safety grants, and a pattern of villainizing department leaders that did not report directly to Mayor’s Office and follow their directives. </p><p>Naively, egotistically, on some level I thought that giving these comments would be the nudge they needed to get back on track. A little radar blip telling the O’Connell administration their plane was flying too close to the mountain range of broken promises.</p><p>Since February 2024, I’ve continued to speak out about issues like this, and I’ve suffered consequences because of it. I’ll tell you about that in a bit.</p><p>As you head into the holiday break, I want you to keep something in mind. You will be approached, if you haven’t been already, with proposals to consolidate power in the Mayor’s Office—to give up oversight, to streamline processes, to make governing “more efficient.” </p><p>You’ll hear compelling arguments about why the Mayor needs more autonomy to hire and fire department heads without Boards and Commission having any say in the matter. </p><p>Before you make those decisions, I want to share what I learned working inside that office about the difference between politics and governance, and while that distinction is very important, it doesn't seem like Metro’s senior most politician understands the difference. And it's not entirely his fault or doing or idea.</p><p>There is a veritable neo-liberal industrial complex being propped up by foundations like the Bloomberg Philanthropies (the billionaire-funded foundation that brought Nashville’s COO Kristin Wilson from the corporate world into government) that is training America's leaders to corporatize our local governments by quote-unquote “depoliticizing” them. It's a shift that is received by private industry and would be autocrats alike with hooting and hollering.  </p><p>But governments are not corporations. Their goals are not to maximize revenue for stockholders. And the way corporations operate, with a chief executive with hire/fire power over everyone beneath them, that does not translate into systems that actually provide the most good for the most people. </p><p>Since democratic governments are not actually corporations, they can't actually forego all semblance of public oversight and democracy, so when people try to turn them into corporations, they have to obscure the fact that all power flows to the top. They have to create rationalizations of why this is actually MORE democratic. And they'll use any argument that you're willing to buy.</p><p>Got a core value? They’ve got an argument for why consolidating power in their hands aligns with it. Don't buy it.</p><p>And what happens when people start stating the obvious, that the emperor has no clothes, that this is a democracy in name only? They get retaliated against for stepping out of line. They get swatted down. But it won't always be that way.</p><p>There are moments in history when what was once unspeakable becomes necessary to speak. </p><p>When the cost of silence becomes too high, and someone breaks the omertà around abuse that everyone knew was happening but no one was supposed to name. We saw this with #MeToo and sexual harassment—Trump’s first administration was so brazen about sexual assault that it finally gave people permission to name what everyone knew was happening, and the dam broke.</p><p>What I’m about to tell you isn’t about sexual abuse. It’s about a different kind of abuse of power—the economic and political retaliation that keeps people silent, that punishes accountability, that holds vulnerable communities hostage. The kind where leaders hold financial guns to the heads of our most vulnerable and say “talk, and I pull the trigger.” </p><p>And Trump’s second administration—withholding SNAP, weaponizing the funding of federal agencies, threatening cities that don’t comply—is creating another one of those moments. If we are against this at the federal level, we need to be against it when we see it in Nahville. And I believe we’re at one of those moments where the unspeakable needs to be spoken.</p><p>I’m not saying that moment is fully here yet. I’m not saying if you start speaking out, you will be safe from further retribution. But like we saw with #metoo, once there is a critical mass of people willing to be honest about it, they can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. And that's when the world changes. Over night.</p><p>If you're in power and this makes you nervous—if you see the writing on the wall and don’t want to be a casualty to the moral evolution of our society, falling from grace like some of the Democrats caught up in #MeToo: Governor Andrew Cuomo, San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, US Senator Al Franken, and US Representative John Conyers, you may want to change your behavior. Quickly.</p><p>This “strong mayor” model is just autocratic strongman autocracy on a local level. Its only difference from the political model in Washington is that a mayor has much more immediate ability to harm their most vulnerable constituents. I know some of you disagree. </p><p>I know some of you feel this is actually <em>more democratic </em>to put this power into the hands of a single executive that is subject to oversight once every four years. I ask you, in all sincerity, if you believe this, do something that has long been the cornerstone of American democracy: debate me. Pick a time and place. I’ll bring the lecterns.</p><p>But until anyone can make a convincing argument to the contrary, this is how I see it: wielding unchecked power without accountability (outside of elections every four years)… <em>that’s not the vibe.</em></p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image

historical memory, critical thinking and collective identity — now begins to take the form of an acute indifference, withdrawal from public life and a disdain for politics that amounts to a political catastrophe.”<br><br>Henry A. Giroux<br>October 15, 2019</p></div><h2>When accountability is met with retaliation</h2><p>After I gave that public comment in a Metro Council Budget and Finance Committee in February 2024, asking you to hold the O’Connell administration accountable to the “truly progressive” agenda they campaigned on, I followed up with articles about the controversy around Metro Arts. I focused on this issue to transpose my heartbreak about what was happening to the community safety work I had been dedicated to the last few years.</p><p>In the background, I spoke to many of you on Council about the inequities taking place with how these funds were being dispensed (or, rather, weren't being dispensed). </p><p>Community nonprofits that had been awarded grant contracts by the Community Safety Partnership Fund Advisory Board after an RFP processes and passed through the Metro Council, were being told they did not have a valid contract and would not be paid out by the Health Department (the agency O’Connell had shipped the remaining Community Safety staff to, who either quit, filing complaints with HR over toxic work environments, or were fired without cause). </p><p>It was only after I pulled the signed contracts from the Metro Contracts database that Metro Health, under duress, began paying vendors.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

My emails used to be so much more friendly.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I began writing about Metro Arts, and the racialized inequity there, so as to not seem like just an “angry former employee” (which, I’m sure, I have been portrayed as being to those displeased with my public comments and investigative reporting).</p><p>I am sure that this story I am about to tell you has been used to explain why I am such a critic of this Mayor’s Office, claiming that I am lashing out because of this thing I’m about to tell you about. </p><p>But just to timestamp things, my Feb 20, 2024 concerns about inequity brought to Metro Council came more than 6 months before what happened with the Mayor’s Chief of Staff in fall of 2024.</p><p><strong>I had a contract gig after my time at the Mayor’s office with one of the region’s largest philanthropies that has deep ties to the Mayor’s Office. When the project I was working was going to involve some amount of contact with O’Connell’s office, my name came up. This was a problem for them.</strong></p><p><strong>The CEO of the philanthropy got a call from the Mayor’s Chief of Staff. Immediately launching into screaming at him, he was told he had to fire me. “Have you heard what Mike Lacy has been saying about Metro??!”</strong></p><p><strong>“Yes,” he told me he replied. “I’m a subscriber.” Love that guy.</strong></p><p>The criticism she was outraged about, where I was discussing the behavior of Metro Nashville leaders in respect to Metro Arts—positions which now are very much the established understanding of “what broke and how it was improved”—it was as if I had been personally attacking her. </p><p>Metro Nashville, in her mind, was <em>her</em>. And a critique, even one with lots of jokes and ai generated memes (my work was much less serious back then) was treated like an unmotivated character assassination from a supposed ally. And she was intent on treating my (hardly read) blog post with nuclear retaliation.</p><p>The main takeaway for the CEO, to his immense credit, was to ask if she was ok and that he was very concerned for her wellbeing. He also promptly informed me of this phone call, which I think was the ethical thing to do.</p><p>At a later point, Mayor O’Connell actually apologized to me in person for this incident, and assured me that she was told she must never do this again. She remained in this position for another year, however, after this incident. And I am curious if she indeed never did something like that again. </p><p>But the point is, that is not an example of governing, it’s an example of <em>politics</em>. And I’m not sure that people like Freddie O’Connell, and Council members he is seducing to give him unrestrained powers, actually understand the difference.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“Yet, citizens who want to help empower their political values would be better off if they spent less time consuming politics as at-home amateurs and instead fell in line to help strengthen organizations and leaders. Rather than kibitzing with their social media friends, they could adopt some of the spirit of the party regulars, counting votes and building interpersonal relationships in their neighborhoods.”<br>Eitan Hersh</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

in, I was kind of vague with my reasons. I didn’t feel comfortable saying that it was because, several months into the administration that ran on having a “Community Safety Plan on Day One,” the office I worked for under him, the Office of Community Safety, hadn’t received so much as an email asking what we were doing. </p><p>I figured they just needed to shuffle the deck, get some fresh blood in, and the ball would get rolling. We weren’t <em>fired</em>, but based on the fact that the only conversation anyone from the admin had had with me was: “Why can’t you use the downstairs coffee machine?” it seemed like we weren’t exactly <em>hired</em> either. We were just, “not fired.”</p><p>It was weird.</p><p>The thing was, I was deeply burned out at that point. To mix metaphors, after almost two years in the Mayor’s Office, I felt like a salmon tasked with not only swimming upstream, but herding cats at the same time—cats that were very eager to eat me and the salmon I was trying to help.</p><p>I told O’Connell’s first chief of staff that I had accomplished what I had set out to do, and that working in a political office just wasn’t for me anymore at this time.</p><p>She lurched back in her seat. “This isn’t a political office. The politics stopped with the campaign. This is <em>governing</em>.”</p><p>I looked at her, and reflected on what I had just lived through. I realized that I, a 33-year-old with unkempt hair and no decent suit to speak of, had vastly more experience working in an office such as this than the woman who was now Chief of Staff in the state capital of Tennessee.</p><p>I could not tell if her comment was cynical, or naive. Now with as much time out of the Mayor’s Office as in it, reflecting on what my experience was there, and learning from the outside—developing relationships with politicians on a state and local level, connecting more deeply (often covertly) with current government workers, speaking with the most vulnerable constituents who often experience rose-tinted neoliberal programs and policies for what they are—I have a better sense of how I feel about that comment.</p><p>To say that what a Mayor’s Office does is to exclusively govern, and to not act politically, is both extremely cynical AND naive. And I think that is a perfect way to describe many of our most powerful politicians.</p><h2>When criticism becomes a threat to identity</h2><p>To people like Mayor O’Connell, who haven’t mentally and emotionally prepared themselves for offices of this stature, I am convinced they’ve conflated their identity with the role they’re filling. This makes it hard for them to distinguish between bad faith personal attacks and the firm hand of community accountability.</p><p>Take what happened with Old Tent City. Open Table Nashville (OTN) had been vocal critics of both the secret encampment closure plan with no real long term solutions for the residents whose bodies were being nonconsensually relocated and O’Connell’s push for mass surveillance via FUSUS. </p><p>They’re not the only organization with intelligent, compassionate leaders who can connect these dots—but they are one of the only orgs serving this population that doesn’t take money tracing back through the Office of Homeless Services and its sole oversight authority, the Nashville Mayor’s Office.</p><p>At a spring homelessness panel, an OTN leader critiqued the Mayor’s FUSUS plans, explaining that surveillance disproportionately impacts the unhoused and minorities. People held up signs denouncing FUSUS. He was visibly furious. He stormed away shortly after the panel ended, blowing off two unhoused neighbors I tried to introduce him to who had some questions about pending encampment closures.</p><p>When Old Tent City’s closure came, I tried to facilitate a meeting between O’Connell and families being relocated who weren’t getting their questions answered by OHS and Director Calvin. Given that he’s her exclusive oversight with any real power, I was very happy to get a meeting formally on his calendar. I felt like I was using my connections and ability to speak fluently across the income aisle to actually make some positive changes. The plan was to work with OTN to connect him with these residents and to have him visit Old Tent City a few weeks before the formal close date and hear them out.</p><p>But it all fell apart, basically immediately, because Freddie got butthurt. OTN released a petition the same day I told them about the meeting—collecting questions from residents and thanking the Mayor for agreeing to meet. He flipped his shit. His elliptical text messages suggested he thought this was a giant ploy, that I’d set him up. </p><p>He wasn’t about to let people who criticize him publicly “take credit” for getting him to talk to a his constituents he was relocating by force. He was certain media would be there, that it would be a circus designed to make him look bad.</p><p>He even had his staff put as much in email.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

from his office to my knowledge followed up with the residents asking for help.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Looking at his furious yet confusing text messages, I took a few deep breaths and strategized on how to “coach up” this grown man having a temper tantrum—someone whose chief of staff had explicitly tried to get me fired months earlier. I had somehow buried that hatched. Yet he seemed unable to have the mildest criticism not steer him away from an easy political win.</p><p>I strategized a compromise: I’d cut OTN out entirely, go to Old Tent City myself, develop these relationships personally. I went there and set it up. And amazingly, he agreed to meet with them. But then he flaked. He got busy. I couldn't even get one of his staffers to call these families and head them out.</p><p>This is what happens when leaders conflate criticism with personal attack. Vulnerable families who needed their mayor got abandoned because he couldn’t handle being publicly challenged by an organization that doesn’t depend on his office for funding.</p><p>And the families I wanted him to meet with? Their situations are even more fucked up than the ones you’ve been reading about.</p><h2>The power you’re being asked to surrender</h2><p>So let me ask: does this sound like the behavior of someone who clearly understands the difference between governance and politics?</p><p>That chief of staff is gone. The new one, seemingly handpicked for him by Bill Lee and Cameron Sexton—was that a governance decision in the best interest of our city, or a political decision that takes the heat off him for posting a useless spreadsheet about phone calls from ICE?</p><p>He would likely say it is both. That he cannot govern Nashville if he is not politically liberated to do so. But Freddie O’Connell is not Nashville. And governance is not for him alone to do. We live in a representative democracy, with nested levels of decision making, each a check and balance on the other spheres of power.</p><p>There are reasons we would not want the presidency to have hire/fire power over all government positions, but clearly Donald Trump would like it—he’d happily pick the Governor of every state if he could.</p><p>There are reasons we would not want the Governor to pick every Mayor. Bill Lee would put his business partners and cronies in power everywhere if he could.</p><p>And there are reasons we would not want the Mayor to pick every department head. Freddie O’Connell would pick whoever made him feel good and didn’t challenge the idea that he is not always the smartest or most “truly progressive” person in the room.</p><p>But that is precisely what the Mayor is asking Council Members to do. And some of you, the very ones who have brought up to me, unprompted, these very same personality flaws I’m talking about, seem willing to give it to him. And even if our affable, goofy, thin-skinned Mayor is the kind of despot you think we can “manage,” what about the next one? </p><p>After a pretty abysmal showing by an alleged “progressive”, if Nashville follows the presidential trend, isn't it likely, unless an actual progressive primaries O’Connell or he does not run, that Nashville will go with a far-right conservative because most out-of-touch voters think “we tried that progressive thing and it didn't work”?</p><p>Or are you only thinking about this term, and you’re going to make that some future Council Member’s problem? Some future Nashville’s problem? The problem of impoverished Nashvillians who can’t navigate Metro’s obscure paths to free bus fare, making them choose between walking 2 miles to the grocery store, or having their children go hungry?</p><h2>What they’ll tell you</h2><p>You have been or will be approached and asked to surrender your ability to have oversight on who controls our limited (increasingly limited) public resources, and to remove democratic governance from this hiring process, and to put it in the hands of the highest <em>political</em> office in the city. And you'll be asked to do this in the name of democracy, and maybe even, somehow, “anti-racism.” As if no Mayor of Nashville could be a racist.</p><p>Remember that when you are approached by them:</p><p>They will come with threats in the form of tanking legislation for your district, leveraging the essential care of Nashvillians to force their preferences on your constituents.</p><p>They will come to you with ersatz bribes in the form of MRRF funds to move the bodies of undesirables from overpasses and bus stop benches into a system that, we have demonstrated, will disappear your constituents into even worse situations without oversight or repercussions.</p><p>And they will say things about us:</p><p>They will say we are acting in bad faith, despite the fact that we are consistent in our values, constant in our faith in transparency and accountability applied in all directions, even to ourselves.</p><p>They will say we are retaliating against <em>them</em> for their vindictive behavior, even though we are on public record asking them to live up to their campaign promises months before they committed this retribution precisely <em>because</em> we asked you to hold them accountable.</p><p>They will say we lack information to understand what’s going on, even though they are the ones hoarding this information, refusing to even reveal how they’ve spent public funds and burying their financial and programmatic malfeasance as just “growing pains” and “nothing to see here.”</p><p>They will say we are trying to make government “too political” even though they are the highest explicitly political office in the city-county, exempt from Fair Labor Standards Act in hiring because they are, in the language of state code, <em><a href="https://www.ctas.tennessee.edu/eli/elected-officials-and-their-personal-staff">political employees</a></em>.</p><p>They will tell you that politics is for elections, not for council meetings. This is a willful, cynical and naive, dangerous misreading of how democracy works. And when they say this, tell them to find me, and a podium, and prepare to debate. Advise them to bone up on their Federalist Papers, and be sure they know that I will go Super Saiyan if they bring up Richard Florida.</p><h2>The coalition that’s building</h2><p>Those of us who are building a coalition—a coalition around public transit and the failures to deliver on its promises, on immigration and the lack of any staff in the <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/mayor/staff-directory">Mayor’s Office of New Americans</a> during the greatest federal assault on immigrants since WWII, on the disappearing of our unhoused neighbors in a political climate that would sooner have them in internment camps than on a master lease, and all of those across the political, ideological, and issues spectrum who believe that government should be accountable and transparent and, at a minimum, just tell us what the fuck they’re doing with our money—here’s the way we behave that’s different.</p><p>We have values. </p><p>We say what we mean. </p><p>Our threats are explicit because our power is explicit. They are no obscured to hide the source of our power because our power is explicit. We will not vote for you, we will publicize your lack of follow-through on your promises, and we will protest you within graduated degrees of sanctions until you lay heed to the public’s will. But we are not vindictive. </p><p>We don’t see this as a team sport where if you don’t start on our team, you’re our enemy. Like Lincoln, we destroy our enemies when we make them our friends. And we actually want what we’re openly saying, and no amount of clandestine coffee meetings or elliptical texting where we’re asked “who can we give a job to to make you stop talking” will shut us up.</p><p>Look. I have good taste. And acting like children, like this is high school, like the popular kids get to decide what the student council does and that we should be grateful because the cafeteria now sells pizza twice a month instead of once—<em>that’s not the vibe.</em></p><h2>Your choice</h2><p>What you do will outlive your term.</p><p>Unconsidered quick wins in the now is what always leads to catastrophe in the future. The precedents you help set may not impact your district in the next two years, but they well may change the city forever, and you will be responsible for that.</p><p>When you are governing, consider this: will your political decisions now make it so that, when all the chickens come home to roost, when other people enter these roles that you don’t feel so confident you can “manage,” isn’t it quite possible, even inevitable, that it would change this city so much that you would no longer want to #StayInNashville?</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.
