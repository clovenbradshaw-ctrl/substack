<p>I wrote to you recently about something that was giving me much hope in these dark days. It seemed like people appreciated me being <em>positive</em> for once, when I praised the delightful bench building project undertaken by <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jesus Urbanist&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:5910053,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;pub&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/jesusurbanist&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6a460b9-d19c-4493-8ffc-6f3a72d8f209_650x650.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;3cdff67b-e31a-419f-8e76-443a635d65c8&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>, aka Pastor Robin L.

The driver of the truck, as if with a vendetta against the very idea of sitting, lifted the bench up in quick motion and tossed it into his truck’s cab.</p><p>I pulled over behind him and honked and shouted. </p><p>“Hey, man!” I shouted.

I’ve done it. Though this bench was definitely giving <em>infrastructure</em> over <em>free shit on the side of the road.</em></p><p>But there is a reason why municipalities drill things into the ground — they’re liable to end up in someone’s truck bed sooner or later. But it was a crazy thing to see this one snatched up in broad daylight. And the abduction didn’t have the vibe of: “hmm let me check this out before I bring it into my home.” As a former New Yorker, you never just <em>take something off the side of the road.</em></p><p>I texted a Metro Official familiar with the bench project, and their immediate reaction was: “I had heard a rumor that WeGo was having them removed.”</p><p>I don’t have anything to substantiate that. That’s the definition of hearsay. </p><p>But if there’s any glimmer of truth to it, it would be an absurd self-own on WeGo and/or Metro’s part to vindictively snatch up these benches. It’s giving <em>Choose How You Lose</em>.</p><p>So I’ll just ask to clear the air:<br><br><em>WeGo, NDOT, Freddie: <strong>this you?</strong></em></p><p>Do y’all have feelings about the benches? </p><p>Do you <em>get it?</em> Do you get why this is important to people?</p><p>You kind of have an easy PR lay-up here to be like: <em>“Yes, we love the bench project! This is the kind of coming together we’re all about! Infrastructure, yay! We love the benches!”</em></p><p>Then you can give the perfunctory: <em>“something… something… safety… procurement… liability… permanent benches coming soon.” </em>But don’t forget to wrap it up with, “Benches are great! Who came up with ‘Music Seat-y’, that’s so clever!”</p><p>Even if you’re <em>not</em> the ones taking the benches and are deeply <em>scandalized</em> by the matter, it’d really help get y’all out of this dialectical rut where the community increasingly feels like you’re at war with us if you <em>took a hint.</em> </p><p>This is the kind of thing we care about. </p><p>This is how we’re showing love to our neighbors. </p><p>To the Metro Leaders caught up in this, the Dianas, Stephens, Freddies, and Jacobs — maybe consider snapping a selfie on one of these benches? Like not to rob your PR people of labor, but it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p><p>Sure it’s a small gesture of solidarity, but no one is expecting y’all at the protest if we’re honest. We’re looking for a: “Yeah, we’re into <em>this</em>.” </p><p>There’s a lot we’re all <em>against</em> these days. It would be nice if it felt like you were <em>for something</em> we also wanted. It would really help resolve the <em>crunchy vibes</em>. It’s hard for people to take seriously that <em>we’re the problem</em> when even this becomes a political 3rd rail for y’all.</p><p>Activists are always critiqued for being too confrontational, for being too up in people’s faces, for being too critical in our thinking and firm minded in our opinions. Well, this one isn’t a hardline political position. It’s <em>benches.</em> It’s intentionally a boring, basic ass thing.</p><p>And what is a bench but an invitation. <em>Have a seat.</em> Have a chat with a neighbor waiting for a bus. Ask them about their bus route preferences and poke around in the WeGo app (it’s actually not bad). Take a photo on Music Seat-y.</p><p>Please, take a seat. But leave it there.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
