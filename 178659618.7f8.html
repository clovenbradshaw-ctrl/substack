<p>Here’s the complete post:</p><div><hr></div><p>They do not trust us because trusting us would challenge the way they say the world works.</p><p>Who are they? They are liberals. They are the consulting class. They are the priesthood of McKinsey and the Bloomberg Foundation. They are the revolving door of Wall Street, lobbying, real estate, and—when they’re feeling charitable—  <em>politicians and government officials.</em></p><p>The ones who are truly of this class are sincere in their fear of us. They legitimately cannot comprehend collective, emergent, democratic decision-making.</p><p>At the end of the last century, many of them—the ones who are more academically inclined, at least—found immense solace and self-satisfaction in Francis Fukuyama’s “The End of History.” Liberal democracy, described and ascribed for all time as the end point of humanity. Not yet everywhere, but once market forces align across the globe, they herald an era of unending peace, governed by technocratic, ochlocratic frameworks: KPIs, GDP.</p><p>This is what they defined as liberal democracy—this ethos of neoliberalism. But it’s not democratic. It’s not rule of the people in any meaningful way.</p><p>The idea they offered us—the idea underneath the idea—is business operations. A chief who executes the operations, determines how things happen, how it will operate, incentivizing actions to produce the most value for stakeholders. No one would argue that a corporation is a democracy. The employees in an LLC don’t vote on who governs them.</p><p>Transparency is only a prerequisite if you want to partake in transactions with the investor class under the stock market. You’re only owed what the state you operate in requires of your overlords: two weeks notice. What’s required of you to leave and get a recommendation? Pack up your things and leave. <em>Now.</em> It’s the best you can expect when you are fired.</p><p>This is the ethos—what’s actually under the hood of neoliberalism. Not democracy. Dictatorship. Serving beneath a bureaucratic class. Not technocracy—plutocracy. Oligopoly.</p><p>When we say things about collectivism, about solidarity, about lived experience, about collective decision-making, about transparency, about accountability—these are threats. These are dangers to them.</p><p>Because beneath all that technocratic language, beneath the consulting decks and the impact metrics and the stakeholder frameworks, there’s something older. Something more primal.</p><p>It’s the logic of the strongman. The warlord. The boss who takes what he can take because he can take it. Raw power dressed up in a suit, learning the language of “efficiency” and “optimization” to justify what it was always going to do anyway: consolidate, extract, control.</p><p>This is why they react with such visceral fear to our language of solidarity and collective power. Not because they’ve reasoned their way to some philosophical opposition. But because any challenge to their territory, any suggestion that resources might be shared or decisions made collectively, triggers something deeper than ideology. It’s the threat response of someone who’s built an empire and will defend it.</p><p>They’ve learned to coat it in the rhetoric of inevitability—”market forces,” “fiduciary responsibility,” “economic reality.” But strip that away and you’re left with the same old story: I have this, it’s mine, and I’ll use whatever force necessary to keep it.</p><p>The tragedy is that so many people who could build something together—who share values of hard work, of community, of actually taking care of things that matter—have been taught to see each other as threats instead of allies. Taught to compete for scraps while empires consolidate above them.</p><p>What we’re offering isn’t chaos. It’s not weakness. It’s the strength that comes from actually working together. From transparency that builds trust. From accountability that creates resilience. From collective decision-making that taps wisdom no single chief executive could ever possess.</p><p>What we’re building isn’t about tearing down and leaving nothing. It’s about making room.</p><p>Room for the person who needs clear structure and shared values to guide them. Room for the entrepreneur who sees opportunities and wants to build. Room for the organizer who understands that real change comes from collective action. Room for the systems thinker who can see the whole picture emerging.</p><p>This isn’t about flattening everything into sameness. It’s about creating conditions where different ways of being, different ways of knowing, different ways of organizing can actually <em>work together</em>. Where the person who values tradition and the person who values innovation aren’t enemies—they’re necessary complements.</p><p>What we’re building in Nashville—what we’re documenting, what we’re making transparent, what we’re organizing around—it’s a demonstration. Not a blueprint to be copied everywhere, but proof that another way is possible.</p><p>The accountability work isn’t just about catching bad actors. It’s about building the trust infrastructure that makes cooperation possible. The transparency isn’t just about exposing corruption. It’s about creating the shared knowledge base that lets a community actually govern itself.</p><p>The technical infrastructure—the secure communications, the documentation systems, the community platforms—these aren’t just tools. They’re the scaffolding for something new to grow. Something that can hold complexity. Something that can evolve.</p><p>We’re not asking anyone to abandon what matters to them. We’re asking them to look at what’s actually working, what’s actually building resilience in their communities, and what’s just extracting value while calling it leadership.</p><p>There’s room for all of us in what comes next. But not for systems that demand we compete for scraps while empires consolidate above us.</p>
