<p>My last big piece was a “take down” of sorts of Oracle —though I don’t think just typing up what its co-founder has said for decades what they want to do is a “take down” per se. It’s more of a: <em>“uh, hey guys, we cool with this?”</em></p><p>If I were to judge by the responses I got from every day Tennesseans, I’d say the answer is a deafening “no.” If I were judge based on what the politicians who I can see have read my emails have said, the vibe is more: “let me talk to their lobbyist and get back to you.”</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;f61d4d5b-61f5-4753-8fdb-2917dd234e5c&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The TechnoFutilist Doctrine Comes to Tennessee&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;What exactly does Oracle want to do in Nashville?

Specially, all the data.</p><blockquote><p><em>“I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can. We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it’s easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like. That’s the missing link.”</em><br><br>(Fortune, Feb 14, 2025).</p></blockquote><p>And here is where I am supposed to terrify you about the dangers of this, how this is everything we trained on to be afraid of via young adult dystopian novels for the past half century. And, in point of fact, <em>it is.</em> </p><p>But there’s something curious about this hunger to eat the world that Oracle and Ellison won’t publicly admit to. It’s a problem that they, and the big data aggregators keep coming across, and are not going to solve. This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t be worried about what they’re going to do with our health records, of cellular data, our bank transactions, all able to be provided through “collaboration” with law enforcement of their own accord, <em>but it is something that I know keeps them up at night.</em></p><p>The problem is that they can’t actually <em>consume the data.</em> The can scrape it into their mouth, chomping down on it like Galactus taking a bit out of the Baxter Building, but they can’t actually make much <em>sense out of what they’re consuming.</em></p><p>Sure, can they run a query through their vast datasets and create a join table of personal identifying information of people who ask ChatGPT things that put them on a watch list.</p><pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT 
    u.user_id, 
    u.username, 
    u.email,
    u.address,
    u.ssn
FROM users u
JOIN messages m ON u.user_id IN (m.sender_id, m.receiver_id)
WHERE UPPER(m.message_content) LIKE ‘%<em><strong>Is fascism bad?</strong></em>%’;</code></pre><p>But promises like Ellison is making, that it can help see patterns with agriculture and cure diseases, on a small scale, <em>will absolutely prove fruitful.</em> But only where they augment the pursuits of human inquiries that are already shaped by the rules that given domains have proven out, where there are observations of emergent properties and tendencies that hold true when taken in context.</p><p>What their AI can <em>definitely</em> can do is export an error-riddled report of anyone is doesn’t fit certain categories of desirability for the state. What no AI currently can do is do things like this, autonomously, and at scale:</p><blockquote><p>The AI model needs to be provided with comprehensive data for context to predict outputs. For agricultural purposes, for example, this means providing all the data of a country’s farms, the utility infrastructures, borders, and climate. If you want to improve population health, for instance, you have to provide all your healthcare and diagnostic data, as well as your electronic health records and your genomic data.</p><p><a href="http://www.worldgovernmentssummit.org">Larry Ellison</a></p></blockquote><p>And it’s not a brute force problem. It’s a metaphysical problem. The problem is that the deep, foundational structure of the relational database, the core of what Oracle built it’s original application for the CIA, and whose logic is actually <em>still at work</em> in the machine learning of AI models, is incapable of dealing with a simple thing:</p><p>Context. Databases erase all context, they store information as if it were <em>the thing in itself</em>. And in many ways, it often <em>is the thing in itself.</em></p><p>Context isn’t extra data; it’s what makes data mean anything in the first place. Strip out context and what you have isn’t knowledge—it’s raw coordinates, ready for whoever has power to decide what they “mean.”</p><p>A database might store the latest of your heart rate. It captures your systole and diastole, e.g. 120/80. It records this number as if <em>it is your heartbeat,</em> and presents it to doctors through an interface, telling them: “at Richard’s last blood pressure was 120/80.” What it usually doesn’t include is the <em>context</em> of this reading. <em>Who took this reading? With what blood pressure cuff? In which electronic health record (EHR) system did they record this number? What field names does that system use? How confident is the system that these metrics mean the same thing in that system vs this one.</em> </p><p>Data is <em>flattened</em> into atomic, discrete facts in databases, the mechanistic aesthetic of data systems leading us to treat everything like precise Newtonian equations. And eventually we stop thinking about Richard’s heart rate as the thing happening in his body, but the thing recorded in his EHR. If a fit bit records a heart beat after you’re dead, are we more likely to think the Fitbit is broken or a person has come back to life?</p><p>But if you delete the record of your heart beat from the database, your heart keep beating. If you leave behind electronic health records entirely, you still have health, even if it isn’t being recorded by the interactions of electrons within transistors. But there are other things that <em>do live only in 1s and 0s.</em></p><p>But if you erase your credit card debt from every instance of your bank’s databases, <em>your debt is gone.</em> </p><p>The ground, the landscape, the frame of reference, the phase space in which things and events unfold, is indifferent to the modernist metaphysics at the heart of most data science.</p><p>Now, data nerds will say: <em>“Actually, AI overcomes that problem. Machine learning doesn’t rely on relational databases. It uses statistical modeling to generate emergent answers. It’s trained on impossibly large datasets. It mimics the random collisions of meaning that happen in the human mind. It’s not a database—it’s something new, maybe even more complex than the real world.”</em></p><p>To which I say: yeah, but not really.</p><p>When you look at what an AI model is <em>actually</em> trained on—typically JSONL format, rows of text paired with labels or probabilities—it’s the same flat, datafied collapse of reality into supposedly “objective” parameters. Every token, every vector, is a coordinate in a space of meaning that’s been forcibly quantized. <em>It’s like someone compressed Shakespeare into a spreadsheet and then taught the spreadsheet to dream [AI wrote that joke]</em>. Each human sentence, each act of sense-making, has been atomized into numeric representations that can be statistically recombined—but never <em>understood.</em></p><p>What the AI is great at is <strong>recombination</strong>—not cognition. It can blend parameters in dazzling ways, and those combinations can sound uncannily <em>truthy</em>. A large language model is, in effect, a <strong>massive semantic join table</strong>, one where the join condition isn’t <code>user_id</code> or <code>order_number</code>, but the probability that one token should follow another in human-like text.</p><p>That’s why it feels contextual—it’s doing <strong>pattern mimicry</strong>, not contextual reasoning. It produces the <em>appearance</em> of understanding by sampling from distributions that have already stripped away the conditions of knowing.</p><p>And in that sense, it’s not a fix for the database problem. It’s the next logical phase of it.<br>Where the database flattened the world into structured rows, the model liquifies it—turning meaning into a probabilistic slurry. There’s no ground, no provenance, no epistemic position. Just endless surface pattern.</p><p>Ask a model for a precise number with a verified source and watch it slip through your fingers. It can asymptotically approach honesty—it can <em>sound</em> right—but it can’t <em>be</em> right in any ontological sense, because it fundamentally lacks what Experiential Ontology would call <strong>frame-indexing</strong>: the ability to recognize <em>from where</em> and <em>under what conditions</em> a claim is true.</p><p>A model can imitate infinite perspectives, but it can’t <strong>see perspective</strong>. There’s no “who,” no “when,” no “why here.” Just an endless “what next?”</p><p>And that’s why Oracle—like plenty of other corporations—keep face-planting when they try to stitch whole universes of context into one neat database.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Purpose</strong></h2><p>To demonstrate how a system can function without pretending to be God.<br>This document offers a practical design pattern—<strong>the hypotenuse architecture</strong>—for any system attempting to integrate heterogeneous realities (e.g., Oracle Cerner’s VA EHR modernization, national health data lakes, or AI models that claim omniscience).</p><p>It is a <strong>theory rendered as interface</strong>, a metaphysical repair kit that can be implemented in code.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>2. Problem Statement</strong></h2><p>Modern data systems—relational databases, data warehouses, machine learning models—are built on a shared metaphysical error:</p><blockquote><p><strong>They treat structure as sufficient to contain context.</strong></p></blockquote><p>That assumption collapses when the world pushes back. Orders vanish, meaning drifts, veterans die.<br>The missing piece isn’t better AI, faster compute, or more data.<br>It’s <strong>ground</strong>—the conditions under which information becomes true.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>3.
