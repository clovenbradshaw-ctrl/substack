This may explain some of the difficulty I’ve personally had obtaining answers to some questions. I haven’t been provided this feedback about how I’ve communicated directly, but I trust the source of this info.</p><p>When I last communicated with high ranking people in the Mayor’s Office, I was asking some hard questions. I think this is the same time they’re pointing to for when they felt like I was being too aggressive. I don’t want to deny anyone’s emotional truth, and as I said in an email I sent to them last week:</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.

We are in alarming times, and it is not lost on me that being in a high profile position comes with great anxiety. I sincerely empathize with the personal stress that this must place on people, and apologize if I’ve ever added to that anxiety.</p></blockquote><p>I want to make room for people to legitimately feel uncomfortable when they are under a microscope. And in all honesty, I know there are times where I did not communicate professionally with at least one member of the city’s senior leadership when there was inaction and a lack of transparency coming from their office. </p><p>But I also want to make room to acknowledge that there is a tendency for people to present themselves as the wronged party when they don’t like questions that are being asked of them. </p><p>And I think both these things can be true. I think they can be <em>playing the victim</em>, and I could have been unprofessional in how I was asking them these questions.</p><p>That I asked these questions unprofessionally does not make my questions unimportant.</p><p>And that these questions are important does not mean that I should have asked them unprofessionally.</p><p>I think many of our city’s leaders have a tendency to act as bullies, and punch down on our most vulnerable and those who advocate for them. I think I have a tendency to bully bullies, but that is still <em>bullying. </em>And it is wrong of me to do. </p><p>This role that’s emerged around me, if I really want to live into it, requires more professionalism than what I exhibited, and there’s something I gotta decide: </p><ul><li><p>Do I want to shift the way I communicate to align with being, as Michele Flynn <a href="https://micheleflynn.substack.com/p/betrayed-by-the-mayor-again">has labelled me</a>, “Nashville’s unofficial Ombudsman”? This would aid my perceived legitimacy — but it also require me to hold my tongue and be more cautious about how I communicate things, no matter how emotionally charged they make me.</p></li><li><p>Or do I want to perceived as just a regular constituent, perhaps one that is slightly more informed on somethings, but still someone who is liable to fly off the handle with powerful people? This would leave me free to express the emotional content of my observations (within the bounds of my commitment to nonviolence), but it would also make it easier for me to be dismissed as someone who is “too much of a wild card” to be “in the room.”</p></li></ul><p>I legitimately have very torn feelings about these approaches, and to people who know me well (including my therapist) this is a <em>very</em> familiar tension I’m expressing.<br><br>I’ve said before that <a href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/p/i-am-not-nashvilles-political-tech">“I Am Not Nashville’s Political Tech Support,</a>” but I do have to acknowledge that in some ways I keep acting like it. And in other ways, like when I text angry things to the Mayor, I don’t act like it. “Inside me there are two wolves,” etc etc.</p><p></p><p></p>
