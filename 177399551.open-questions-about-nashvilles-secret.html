href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/citylimits/ohs-non-traditional-housing-program/article_a359ddae-8c2f-4fe5-9efb-6c6d4321e474.html">City Records Show ‘Non-Traditional’ Housing Program Expanding Under OHS Director</a>”. This piece, as the Scene noted, was made possible through “additional reporting and research” by me. </p><blockquote><p>The city’s top homelessness official quietly created a new housing strategy over the past year to operate outside agreed-upon protocols between Metro and other service providers. The program preceded what Office of Homeless Services Director April Calvin <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/FY2026_Operating_BudgetBook.pdf">termed “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing” during the fiscal year 2026 budget process</a>. In June, Mayor Freddie O’Connell approved an additional $2.4 million in his budget to expand this work to include 100 families.</p><p>According to interviews with the <em>Scene</em>, the effort involved handpicking at least eight families lured by the promise of Section 8 vouchers who were then shuffled between private landlords for months, living on a verbal rent guarantee from the city. In at least two cases, rent money often came late or not at all, prompting landlords to ask tenants directly for rent money they didn’t have and to even initiate eviction proceedings.</p></blockquote><p>Eli and The Scene did a fantastic job giving the highlights of what we know so far, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. I’m convinced that this is a big enough deal, and that this will (and has already) taken up so much of my time, that I need to fundraise in some kind of way to continue this work.</p><p>So I’ve set up a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/142198328">Patreon</a> for this particular investigation. For a one-time, non-recurring fee of $5, you’ll have access to all of the reporting I do for this story moving forward. </p><p>You also, if you want, can sign up for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/15035929/join">recurring donations</a> if you really want to support this type of independent journalism. And if you already or begin to subscribe here on Substack, you’ll get all those investigation updates for free.</p><p>I know very well that even $5 is too much to ask for some, especially those most affected by what I’ve been reporting on. With that in mind, I’ve have set up a “MunciPal Access Pass” for anyone that needs it.

public questions.</p><p><strong>Now that the Scene has published the high-level facts we know about this, </strong>this can’t be dismissed as just some guy on a blog putting strings on a quark board. It has been fact checked and published by a reputable news outlet, and written by one of our town’s most respected journalists. </p><p>So now that we’re on the same page, I have some open questions for Nashville’s leadership about how in the world this happened, and what, if any, are their plans for stopping it.</p><h2>Questions for Metro Leaders on “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing”</h2><h2>For Mayor Freddie O’Connell</h2><ol><li><p><strong>What did you know and when did you know it?</strong> When OHS created this program outside federal oversight, was Director Calvin solving a problem you identified? Was this tied to the documented over-capacity issues at The Rescue Mission? Was this related to clearing away visible homelessness before CMA Fest and the closing of Old Tent City? Did you direct or approve this? Did you know what funds were going to be used for paying rent? Were you aware Metro was making promises to vulnerable families it either did not have the ability to keep, or had no intention of doing so?</p></li><li><p><strong>What other forces determine our city’s homelessness strategy, besides your own dictates as the sole oversight of OHS?</strong> Is this “non-traditional rapid rehousing” your brainchild? Is this your solution to the CoC not allowing you to close encampments inhumanely and without Metro actually providing the $25M backlog of permanent supportive housing that was set aside for this? Did you make promises during your campaign or since in office to downtown business interests, Oracle, or others about gaining some sort of iron fist over the homelessness system by any means necessary? Or do you maintain that concerns about Director Calvin are just, as you have told me and others repeatedly, “a series of unfortunate personality conflicts” and service providers need to just <em>get with the program?</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Explain these phone calls.</strong> Screenshots show calls between your office and program residents days before I brought this to Metro officials’ attention. A resident says she spoke directly with you. What was the substance of this call? Does this power imbalance—the Mayor calling a vulnerable, precariously housed individual—seem appropriate? Did you ask about and/or explain anything regarding the situation this resident found themselves in? Does this make you reconsider the power structure that you designed OHS under such that the sole recourse for any problems are the Mayor? Do you think in your position you are immune from political pressures and can provide the appropriate, trauma-informed professional care for someone who is been harmed by a system that you oversee?</p></li><li><p><strong>Does this affect your confidence in Director Calvin?</strong> You have told me that all criticism of her are merely “ad hominem” attacks and personality conflicts, and that it is the people speaking out who need to less “firm minded” and exercise thinking that is less “critical.” Given the evidence of your director operating shadow housing program operating without contracts, families abandoned when funding ran out, and $500,000 in improper invoices for Strobel House—how do you maintain that position?</p></li><li><p><strong>Why haven’t you fired April Calvin?</strong> After all of this documented mismanagement, what exactly would Director Calvin have to do to lose her job? What <em>is she doing</em> that makes her so valuable? Is her perhaps her willingness to demonstrably operate outside of best practices, ethical constraints, and responsible fiscal stewardship, not a liability, but actually <em>an asset </em>for her? Is her value that she is someone who <em>will </em>operate a shadow homelessness system for you?</p></li></ol><h2>For OHS Director April Calvin</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Did you think you were doing anything wrong?</strong> Were you aware at the time that you had to use public funding for what it was specifically allocated for? Were you under the impression that you had a pool of money that could be used in this way?</p></li><li><p><strong>Define “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing.”</strong> This term appears nowhere in federal housing policy, HUD guidelines, or any recognized housing framework. It’s not even a thing you can find on the internet anywhere. I even tasked an AI to search all known sources for documents of this nature, and it appeared nowhere except for your public comments and the Nashville FY26 budget.  Did you invent this terminology specifically to circumvent federal and local oversight requirements and use funds to rehouse people however you wish? Explain this. Are you inventing from whole cloth a revolutionary new housing process? What were the results of the pilot program that are warranting such a dramatic expansion?</p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substack.com/img/attachment_icon.svg"></image><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">Non Traditional Rapid Rehousing Investigation Of An Invented Housing Term</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">180KB ∙ PDF file</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/api/v1/file/bddbc128-e1b4-45a5-ae53-03bbffe22df4.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://readrichtext.substack.com/api/v1/file/bddbc128-e1b4-45a5-ae53-03bbffe22df4.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div></li><li><p><strong>What happened to these families?</strong> You promised eight families from Nashville Rescue Mission a year of rent and Section 8 vouchers. None got their rent paid for the duration, and some never got vouchers. After I flagged this with you, they were <em>still</em> getting evictions notices over a month later. Have these families been entered back into the HMIS system? Can organizations in the Continuum of Care identify and support them, or have they slipped through the cracks entirely? Is it true OHS kept copies of their leases, but did not provide these to the tenants? Why was OHS not mentioned on these leases. After all of this, are you counting these as “successful exits” from homelessness?</p></li><li><p><strong>How exactly were they supposed to get vouchers?</strong> Why did your staff promise vouchers to them? Once they signed a one year lease for an apartment, would that not mean mean they are in fact <em>housed, </em>and ineligible for a voucher? I have copies of their leases, absolutely nothing about them indicate that this is temporary housing. Was the intent to fraudulently say that this was “temporary housing” and have them qualify for vouchers? Or was there never an intent to follow through? If these tenants were actually evicted, would that not have dramatically hindered their chances of ever having permanent housing again? How could that possibility not be a check on your willingness to put them into a situation like this?</p></li><li><p><strong>Explain Extended Stay America placements.</strong> What has been going on with placing people without any documentation at Extended Stay America? Are these individuals outside Coordinated Entry? How is this justifiable either process-wise or financially? Who authorized paying for rooms without contracts or oversight?</p></li><li><p><strong>Rescue Shelter Request.</strong> You have stated that you undertook this at the request of the Nashville Rescue Shelter because of overflow issues, and there was a known overflow issue there tied to a funding loss and a mission to “House 100 families.” If this was the reason for transitioning these families, why did you decide to break all coordinated entry best practices and use funding that in no way was set aside for this? Why were they led to sign leases but also promised vouchers?</p></li><li><p><strong>Explain the vendor selection process.</strong> How were Extended Stay America, The Avenue, and Hillside Crossing selected for payments without competitive bidding or formal contracts? Who made these decisions and based on what criteria? These first two locations were commonly used for landlord engagement placements that appear legitimate. Were they selected so that the rent payments would be obscured?</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoices and Documentation.</strong> It took months for public records to be released by your department, and they were only provided to a Metro Councilmember after I threatened Metro Legal with going to the state comptroller. Is this what you did not want to make public? And why, when these records were finally released, did the PRR for invoices of “all ARPA related expenses” <em>not include these rent payments?</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Changes to CE manual.</strong> Who told you to submit, the night before a Homelessness Planning Council meeting, changes to the coordinated entry manual in September 2025, that would have validated your office’s ability to move people around outside of coordinated entry? Why did you not bring this proposal through the proper channels of the CoC and HPC? Was this your idea? Was it the Mayor’s idea? Was it Kristin Wilson’s idea? Why, with all of the havoc that your department has been causing in the homelessness system in Nashville, with no net improvement in housing placement in years despite manyfold budget increases, did you think obtaining even more autonomy would ever lead to better outcomes?</p></li><li><p><strong>Ties to business interests and lobbyists. </strong>What relationship does the policy of your office have to business interests, including but not limited to the Nashville Tourism Bureau, The Chamber of Commerce, the Nashville Downtown Partnership, Tom Turner, and Sam Reed? Do you ever defer to them when making policy decisions? Does your direct supervisor, Freddie O’Connell, cite their interests when prescribing what you office must do?</p></li><li><p><strong>Do you support Donald Trump’s criminalization of homelessness?</strong> The American Enterprise Institute was cited in policy documents of Trump’s Office of Housing and Urban Development, quoting Edward Pinto. Pinto has argued that <a href="https://www.aei.org/research-products/testimony/government-policies-are-responsible-for-the-american-housing-crisis-that-is-crowding-lower-income-households-out-of-the-housing-market/">the 1968 Housing Act “led to neighborhood ruination, scandal, housing inflation, and government profit seeking”</a>, and stated that <a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/housing-finance-policy-center/projects/housing-finance-reform-incubator/edward-j-pinto-its-time-put-market-back-housing-finance">affordable housing programs lead to “blight and urban decay” with “untold neighborhood devastation”</a> while denouncing <a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/kamala-harriss-housing-plan-would-be-worse-than-doing-nothing/">all forms of government housing intervention</a>.<br><br>You’ve spoken on <a href="https://www.aei.org/events/13th-annual-housing-center-conference/">at least one panel</a> set up by the American Enterprise Institute, and invited a speaker to present an AEI presentation to Nashville 2025 Homelessness Symposium who presented on a framework that opposes all government housing interventions, leaving the free market to solve all housing problems. In what way do your values <em>not</em> align with the current administration’s approach to homelessness? Would you support the National Guard coming to Nashville to deal with the unhoused? If there was such a plan put forth by the federal government, with you speak out against it?</p></li></ol><h2>For Nashville Rescue Mission</h2><ol><li><p><strong>What was your role?</strong> OHS claims they acted “at your request” to move eight families. Did this happen? And if so, did you specifically request they bypass Coordinated Entry and federal requirements?</p></li><li><p><strong>Did you track outcomes?</strong> What happened to the families recruited from your facility? Did you follow up when they were abandoned, or did you wash your hands of them?</p></li></ol><h2>For Metro Council</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Why didn’t you know?</strong> How did OHS spend over $100,000 in diverted ARPA funds without a single council member noticing until citizens did your oversight job for you? Are you provided any access to how Metro funds are spent? And if not, in what way do you perform <em>any</em> meaningful oversight? And what are you doing to obtain this view into Metro Finances?</p></li><li><p><strong>What are you doing about it?</strong> Beyond authorizing an audit, what concrete steps are you taking to ensure no Metro department can ever again create shadow programs with federal funds?</p></li><li><p><strong>Who’s reviewing the contracts?</strong> Every OHS contract needs forensic review. Who is doing this work, what is their timeline, and will the findings be public?</p></li><li><p><strong>CM Johnston, what did you know and when did you know it? </strong>You are known to be extremely close with Director Calvin, and people I’ve spoken to have referred to you as the “shadow director” of OHS. You staunchly defended their requests for additional funding for FY26, which included a $2.4M line item for expanding this covert program. <br><br>In either your official oversight capacity or your informal involvement with OHS, were you aware that ARPA funds were going to pay rent for Nashvillians that had been completely removed from the general coordinated entry system and led to sign leases under false pretenses and promises of housing vouchers? If you were aware, how did you let this happen? If you were not aware, in what way can we trust your oversight on such matters?<br></p></li><li><p><strong>CM Erin Evans:</strong> Where have you been on this? As (now former) chair of Public Health and Safety, how did you miss a shadow housing program operating outside federal oversight? </p></li><li><p><strong>CM Jeff Huffman:</strong> You sit on key committees now. What are you going to do to investigate this and stop this from continuing?</p></li><li><p><strong>CM Jacob Kupin:</strong> I’m not even going to bother.</p></li></ol><h2>For Metro Finance</h2><ol><li><p><strong>One of these apartment complexes was paid up to $7000 with NO CONTRACT</strong> for performing services that OHS had no authority to provide with federal funding that was meant for something else. If you are not performing the tasks dictated for <em>The Director of Finance </em>in the Metro Charter:<br><br><em>Audit before payment all bills, invoices, payrolls and other claims, demands or charges against the metropolitan government and approve the same only if proper, legal and correct, and duly authorized by appropriations or allotments of appropriations.<br></em><a href="https://library.municode.com/tn/metro_government_of_nashville_and_davidson_county/codes/charter?nodeId=THCH_PTICHMEGONADACOTE_CH1DEMEFI_S8.103SAOWDU">Sec. 8.103.F, Metro Nashville Charter</a><br><br> What is it that you do?</p></li><li><p><strong>How did invoices get paid without contracts?</strong> Depaul USA billed $500,000+ after their contract expired. Housing providers paid invoices with the explanation field that said “RENT” up to $7,000. How did these payments clear your department? </p></li><li><p><strong>Where’s the ARPA fund tracking?</strong> Federal funds require strict reporting. Show us the audit trail for every dollar diverted to the shadow housing program. If you can’t, why not?</p></li><li><p><strong>What other departments are doing this?</strong> I did not start reporting on OHS because I had heard about financial malfeasance, but I find it under every rock I turn over. If OHS can operate shadow programs with diverted federal funds, who else is doing it? What’s your plan to audit every department receiving federal money?</p></li><li><p><strong>Is this why you refused my initial request for the transaction history of Metro Nashville?</strong> Because you knew that if someone actually looked at it it they might see very concerning things? Do you understand that the way to avoid this is transparency? Do you understand that if people know that they cannot do things without it being discovered, that <em>they will be less likely to do illicit things with public money? </em></p></li><li><p><strong>What needs to change?</strong> Senior finance leadership has told me point blank that it is not feasible for them to review every invoice so they leave this to departments to do. I understand the complexity of reviewing these all by hand (and that is not my suggestion), but it does not appear that there is even a functional automated system in place to check if invoices are authorized against proper expenditures. If this is truly not feasible according to you, I see three options:</p><ol><li><p>We change the Metro Charter so that <a href="https://library.municode.com/tn/metro_government_of_nashville_and_davidson_county/codes/charter?nodeId=THCH_PTICHMEGONADACOTE_CH1DEMEFI_S8.103SAOWDU">Sec. 8.103.F</a> does not make this a “you problem”, and we let departments formally do what you are allowing them to do informally: spend whatever money they want, and then pay a third party to check a randomized sample of them later. This, I’d argue, is not working.</p></li><li><p>You get the 13th largest corporation in the world by market cap, Oracle, soon moving its headquarters here, to give you a customer service rep for the R12 product you already own and have them explains to you how to operate a relational database efficiently. </p></li><li><p>We get new leadership in Finance, and not just at the highest level.</p></li></ol></li></ol><h2>For the Homelessness Planning Council</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Why didn’t you stop this?</strong> The 25-member board supposedly oversees coordination between the city and providers. How did OHS operate an entire shadow program without your knowledge or approval?</p></li><li><p><strong>When will you show courage?</strong> I know that many, MANY of you have problems getting paid by OHS and fear retaliation—but how far does it have to go before you speak up? <br><br>Why are the least powerful people in our city, the clients you’re meant to be serving, demonstrating bravery beyond what I am seeing from your leadership? <br><br>Your case managers are speaking out. Your clients are speaking out. Why is leadership, who is <em>infinitely</em> more removed from personal consequences of saying out loud what is going on, not speaking up?<br></p></li></ul><p><strong>When are you serving your board and your self above your clients? </strong>The only group that consistently speaks up about OHS is Open Table Nashville and that’s explicitly because they do not take Metro funds of HUD funds through Metro. <br><br>Organization leaders: Are you more concerned about your salary and making payroll than actually helping the people you are meant to serve? I’m not saying those things aren’t important, but ask yourself: Who are you really serving in that case? If you are profiting off a system that is actively making life <em>worse</em> for your clients, would you not serve them better by just going out of business?<br><br>At what point is your silence and preservation of your org’s status <em>making life worse </em>for Nashville’s unhoused? Will it be next year? Or has it already happened?<br><br>You need to speak up. It is not without consequences. Your silence is active harm.</p><p><br>I am not saying this as someone who has not had to make these choices. I have suffered consequences for speaking up — but I also have the immense freedom to live in truth. And it will not take all of you. It will only take about a quarter of you.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

any of this?</strong> Were you consulted before OHS created “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing”? If yes, how did you approve a program category that doesn’t exist in any theory of serving the unhoused, legitimate or otherwise? How does this not just create an unaccountable slush fund to move people around without any oversight? </p></li><li><p><strong>What’s your liability assessment?</strong> Nashville operated outside federal guidelines with ARPA funds. It coerced people into entering into contracts under false pretenses. What is Metro’s legal exposure? Are we facing clawbacks, penalties, or criminal investigation? <br><br>Think about it like this: how would you see this situation differently if the folks at the heart of this were people that could pay for a lawyer?</p></li></ol><h2>For Tennessee State Comptroller</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Will you investigate?</strong> Nashville diverted federal ARPA funds to operate a shadow housing program without contracts or oversight. They used federal funds not allocated for this and without providing the invoices of their activities in public records request. Does this warrant a state investigation? If not, what does?</p></li><li><p><strong>Pattern or practice?</strong> If OHS can operate this way, what other Metro departments might be misusing federal funds? Will you conduct a comprehensive audit?</p></li><li><p><strong>Where’s the accountability?</strong> What consequences will Metro face for this misuse of federal funds? What mechanisms exist to prevent this from happening again?</p></li></ol><h2>Critical Questions on FY26 Budget Request for “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing”</h2><h3>For Mayor O’Connell and OHS</h3><ol><li><p><strong>You got $2.4 million to legitimize a program you piloted in darknesss that has had completely terrible results. How’d you pull it off?</strong> OHS has now received authorization for “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing”—a program that has been operating covertly, without contracts, outside federal or local oversight. </p></li><li><p><strong>What evidence-based practices will ensure “equity”?</strong> Your budget claims this program “prioritizes those with the greatest need and reduces systematic barriers to housing.” Yet your actual implementation has violated EVERY best practice and led to extreme hardship for the city’s most vulnerable, with zero accountability. What specific evidence-based practices will you use to distribute these funds equitably? Name them.</p></li><li><p><strong>How does this not create a black hole for disappearing people?</strong> Without HMIS tracking, without Coordinated Entry, without contracts—how is this anything other than an opportunity to “disappear” people from homelessness counts with ZERO accountability for what happens to them? </p></li><li><p><strong>Why should anyone have confidence in your “fidelity”?</strong> You operated this shadow program with no oversight, abandoned families when funds ran out, and only now seek authorization after being caught. Why should we believe you’ll operate with any more fidelity now that you’re asking for official funding?</p></li><li><p><strong>What accountability mechanisms exist?</strong> The budget shows this as “Mayor’s Priority - Grows” with the Mayor apparently the only one with oversight. How is it conceivable that the Mayor—who made phone calls to residents in this program—be the ONLY one with oversight on how $2.4 million is spent?</p></li><li><p><strong>Define your “Performance Metric.”</strong> You claim you’ll provide “rental subsidies for 100 households annually.” Based on what methodology? What happens when you fail to meet this metric, as you failed the eight families already?</p></li></ol><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p><strong>Where’s the moral leadership?</strong> Families were promised homes and abandoned. <br><br>Where is your shame?</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Nashville: These questions demand answers, not PR spin.
