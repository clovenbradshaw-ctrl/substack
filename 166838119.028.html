<p>Despite my unabiding love for “newspaper movies” like Spotlight (2015), I’m finding the actual experience of “breaking news” quite unpleasant. Despite what the subjects of my findings may think, I do have much empathy for those I aim to hold accountable. It would really ruin my day to have stuff written about me. I get it.</p><p>But sunlight is nature’s disinfectant. And some of our systems designed for our most vulnerable appear to be fighting off an infection. The lymph nodes are inflamed of the complex web of public-private entities that serve Nashville’s unhoused. To keep stretching this analogy, we have to take stock of whether this has been a mild head cold, or if this is a serious case of sepsis that has infected vital organs.</p><p>I am being vague, but I won’t be vague in the near future. The release last Friday of (very delayed) public records requests has opened avenues of inquiry that deserve serious attention from people far more serious than me. Like I did with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/metro-arts-finances/home">Metro Arts</a>, I will likely be the one closing the gap between “public information” and “information that the public can access.” </p><p>It’s weird to get full on Woodward and Bernstein vibes when you’re fighting for the release of information that is 100% public information. Other cities <a href="https://checkbook.atlantaga.gov/#!/year/All%20Years/">like Atlanta</a> give you a portal directly into their accounts payable database to see who got paid for what, when, and by whom. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://checkbook.atlantaga.gov/#!/year/All%20Years/"

invoices and purchase orders being the very definition of <em>public information.</em> We did just go through a “keep the lights on” budget cycle and I’m not sure there’s appetite to pay competitive wages for “programmers in Metro.” </p><p>I’ve been mulling over the logistics of simply doing a TN Freedom of Information Request on a quarterly basis for <em>all</em> Metro transactions and just having posting that online, similar to what Atlanta has.</p><div><hr></div><ul><li><p>Like in many cities, the phenomenon of “visible homelessness” as a subset of the overall homelessness problem seems to be a major issue for elected officials. </p><ul><li><p>The “visible homeless” are often those who are seen in areas of tourism or commerce where they are considered disruptive and/or not aligned with the image that cities want to present to visitors and investors.</p></li><li><p>They “visible homeless” are also those in “encampments” that may encroach on public property being considered for redevelopment (see Old Tent City) or be in residential / public areas that cause discomfort for residents (see Brookmeade Park).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Homelessness service providers across the world are reticent to unilaterally close encampments when there are not clear paths to permanent housing for individuals. Around the world, this causes much friction between elected officials and service providers. The Office of Homeless Services touts “Housing First” as its model of humane close of encampments, but the way it closes encampments does align with housing first methodology in two critical ways: (1) the unhoused are not engaged to help design their relocation and given legitimate choice in where they are to live, (2) they are not offered “permanent housing”, only temporary housing in motels.</p></li><li><p>In February 2022, a $500k grant was passed through council for a particular organization to generate a report on the ecosystem around homelessness in Nashville. There was no RFP for this report, and the contract was expanded through two extensions to $750k. I’ll leave my thoughts on the origins of this report and the objectivity of its conclusions out of the equation. For now.</p></li><li><p>Based on this report, Nashville embarked on a $50M project to “fix” the broader homeless system using COVID ARPA monies. Mayor Cooper set aside $25M for incentives to build “permanent supportive housing” and $25M for support services for those. </p></li><li><p>Shortly thereafter, Metro consolidated \control of the Continuum of Care by Metro. Metro become the pass-through of all public funds, called the Collaborative Applicant. They are now also the Coordinated Entry Lead, and their staff quite literally set the agendas and schedule the meetings for the operating board of the CoC, the Homelessness Planning Council.</p></li><li><p>The Homelessness Planning Council is defined in its founding documents as an “independent board”, but increasingly it has been categorized as an outgrowth of Metro, manifesting in HPC members with “lived experience” no longer being paid once MDHA was no longer the collaborative applicant.</p></li><li><p>Nashville’s Continuum of Care was likely not a minimally autonomous and functional independent organization when the Homelessness Planning Council and later the Office of Homeless Services were fused to it.</p></li><li><p>This lack of autonomy has led to undue influence of Metro on the activities of the Continuum of Care.</p></li><li><p>In the past few years, Metro changed the Coordinated Entry (CE) Manual to make living in an encampment the top priority for housing and services. This replaced earlier ways of ranking people, like the VI-SPDAT score, which had been agreed upon before.</p></li><li><p>Because agencies that take CoC or ESG funding must follow CE rules — including giving access to their services without extra barriers — this change has allowed Metro to speed up closing encampments. People living in encampments are now first in line for help, and partner agencies are required to accept referrals based on this new priority system.</p></li><li><p>If there is a “point” to the Office of Homeless Services, we must not measure it by its mission statement. As Godmother of systems thinking, Donella Meadows, wrote in <strong>Thinking in Systems: A Primer,</strong> “Purposes are deduced from behavior not from rhetoric or stated goals.” </p></li><li><p>So what is the behavior of OHS?</p><ul><li><p>OHS has not successfully facilitated more housing to come online. It has had contractual and invoicing issues that are causing facilities that Metro gave money to to build such housing to <em>give the money back </em> (Shelby House), or to give away units that should be going to OHS referrals except they aren’t sending any (I Am Next).</p><p></p></li></ul></li></ul>
