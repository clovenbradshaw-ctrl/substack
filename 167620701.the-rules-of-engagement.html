<p>Little Finger, the villain turned anti-hero turned villain again, says in season three of Game of Thrones a line I think a lot: “chaos is a ladder.” By this he means that dramatic shifts in the political world can set the stage for people to ascend above their station. </p><p>What makes Little Finger a villain is that he, like many dastardly rouges of the petite bourgeoisie, can only imagine a single use ladder, themselves its sole user — and they plan to tip the ladder off the side of the castle as they enter the king’s chambers, dagger at their side.</p><p>These are, indeed, times of chaos. And there are everywhere Little Fingers fashioning their single occupancy ladders. But we’re not interested in those ladders. Finding opportunity for self advancement in times of upheaval usually does not require any talent or intelligence. More often than not all it takes to get ahead in times of social turmoil is a lack of conscience and healthy dose of megalomania. We’ve set a grander challenge for ourselves:</p><p>How do we build power <em>with a conscience</em>? </p><p>The path, I think, is by giving up on crafting ladders, and to start building staircases. Spiral ones, to be exact.</p><div><hr></div><p>We’re going to do this by following a pattern that works. By being a pattern that works.</p><p><strong>We don't fight the system and build alternatives separately—we transform the system by becoming the alternative.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p>Little Finger is describing <em>playing the game. </em>Hobbesian, life is nasy, butish, and short, so why not get what could be yours while its gettable. Life’s a game so why not win it?</p><p>The opposite figure would be Ned Stark, a liberal, a rule follower who doesn’t play the game and assumes this will be a model others will follow too. Doesn’t work out for him any of us when we think we can live outside the game.</p><p>Is there an alternative? A synthesis of the two? Yes. It’s <em>game acceptance.</em></p><blockquote><p>The rules of the social game can be changed so as to be fairer and have less harsh consequences when people lose. But there will always be a game and rules that manage it. Game Denial, to ignore the rules and repress the game, will always have negative consequences.</p><p>But there is something real here. Something worth striving for. We can develop the <strong>conditions</strong> for solidarity to blossom. Such Game Change is only possible, in practicality, if we admit the all-pervading existence of the game. To deny the game is to repress and deny the fundamental tragedy of the world. If you argue against me on this point, you are already proving my point. You are trying to win the argument, and making me and my point lose.</p><p>Hanzi Freinacht</p></blockquote><p>But how do we set those conditions? Is it about something we have to learn, or something we have to <em>unlearn? </em>Yes. No.</p><div><hr></div><p>In Nashville we’re going to be doing this more explicitly. If you are interested in advocating for change, you may want to use some of these concepts and see if it helps you gain collective power and get outcomes that are better for everyone — changing the rules of the game.</p><p>If you are in power, you should be aware of this. The rules are changing. Chaos is upon us, but we intent to build a spiral staircase for all of us. And the model</p>
