href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/06/27/nashville-camp-residents-fireworks-show/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">announcement that it was evicting dozens</a> of people from an encampment near Nissan Stadium—just days before the Fourth of July fireworks—sent shockwaves through local service providers and advocacy groups. The stated reason? The camp sat in the path of the fireworks fallout zone. The site was set to be sprayed with fire retardant, though officials have yet to confirm whether the chemicals involved are safe for residents to return afterward.</p><p>Addressing what, exactly, is being sprayed on our riverfront before our beleaguered nation’s 248th, seems like… a good idea to be up front about. Still TBD on that.</p><p>This rushed relocation of 60+ people happened with less than a week’s notice to the general public. It relied on an emergency clause within Nashville’s Coordinated Entry (CE) system—a policy revised in July 2022 to prioritize encampments identified for closure by law enforcement, regardless of individual vulnerability scores. That change, initially framed as an exception, has quietly become standard operating procedure. The site was tagged, residents were suddenly fast-tracked, and the 30-day engagement protocol laid out in Nashville’s own Outdoor Homelessness Strategy was nowhere to be found.</p><p>The situation echoed a troubling trend that started years ago, but has ramped up in recent months. At the beginning of June, more than 120 people were displaced from “Old Tent City” with 60 days’ notice—without being meaningfully included in planning or offered permanent housing.</p><p>Metro’s Office of Homeless Services purports to operate under a “Housing First” framework. They often cite the USICH guidance on “Humanely Closing Encampments,” though they don’t seem to implement its “strategies” with any consistency. That document lists involving displaced residents in planning as “Strategy 1.” OHS’s closing of Old Tent City literally violated the #1 rule for closing an encampment humanely.</p><p>When I asked Dr. Sam Tsemberis, the creator of the Housing First model: “What is a Housing First strategy if permanent housing is not offered at the time of relocation?” (As was the case with Old Tent City), his answer was simple: “Nothing.”</p><p>But this week’s ad hoc camp closure makes Old Tent City’s faint simulacrum of best practices look like the gold standard of Housing First.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>The Nashville Scene covered concerns about the unfettered prioritization of closing encampments above all else, objections that led to multiple high profile resignations from

political and public pressures—including Tennessee’s 2022 law that made sleeping on public land a felony. In this week’s bombastic Riverbank case, city officials are scrambling to provide any form of housing placements—not because the Coordinated Entry system identified these individuals as the most vulnerable by normal metrics, but because the tourism board unintentionally setting them on fire might set off a well-deserved political firestorm.</p><p>Priority was given previously for Old Tent City residents because of a strategic re-writing of the Coordinated Entry manual, which now allows Metro to designate residents in certain encampments as “high priority,” regardless of their other circumstances. That same loophole appears to be in play here, enabling Metro to route fireworks-zone residents to housing ahead of others who’ve waited longer or qualified based on medical or chronic need.</p><p>The authority to reclassify living in an encampment as high risk happened in 2022, but it didn’t happen in a vacuum. It was directly tied to Mayor Cooper’s $50M investment in permanent housing and support services that are supposed to be available for those in encampments being targeted for closures. This is meant to be the “housing” that is “surged” in OHS’ “Housing Surges.”</p><p>But for the vast majority being removed from what stability they have in encampments, the permanent supportive housing allegedly paid for by the $25M is not being offered. The situation makes the term “Housing Surge” land like a cruel euphemism, one that rhymes only too easily with “Housing Purge.”</p><p>The truth is, despite $24.1M already expended from COVID relief monies for this purpose, there is no large backlog of permanent supportive housing (PSH) to transition people into — which is the resource that has allowed cities like Houston to actually get a hold on their homelessness crisis.</p><p>Old Tent City residents are mostly at the Rodeway Inn, not permanent housing. Reports are that some of the lucky few who were placed in a home with a long term lease were installed there last minute, haphazardly placed in residences that would never pass any form of housing inspection.</p><p>What limited numbers of formal permanent supportive housing units have come online from Metro’s $25M investment are far outstripped by the pace of encampment refugees Metro is displacing.</p><p>Metro has spent the money, but they have vanishingly little to show for it. Yet they expect to have the legitimacy to close encampments at a moment’s notice regardless. And service providers appear tacitly to co-sign this, even if they grumble in private or “only on background” to people like me.</p><p>Even April Calvin, director of the Office of Homeless Services (OHS), when speaking on this week’s fireworks evictions, <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/07/01/july-1-homeless-camp-garcia-release-officers-decomissioned-tsu-coach-departs/">acknowledged the deviation from proper process</a>. “It absolutely does upset the process when we don’t use our strategy, or there’s an emergency situation or a crisis that interrupts that process,” she told the Nashville Banner. </p><p>When even OHS, the agency that I've spent several thousand words detailing their non-compliance to best practices in homelessness response, say things are outta wack — you know something's gone off the rails.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://readrichtext.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">{Rich Text} is a reader-supported publication.

But the circumstances matter. This wasn’t a system functioning as it should—it was a crisis-driven workaround. Meanwhile, thousands of others wait silently on Coordinated Entry lists, stuck without that same urgency or opportunity because no one decided to explode things on top of their encampments.</p><p>That’s not just unfair—it’s destabilizing. It teaches people that the best way to get housed is to live visibly and hope a political fire drill lands in your backyard. And more than that, it erodes any trust in the idea that <em>there is a plan </em>to begin with and that Metro leadership values anything besides business interests that want to see more tourist bang for their buck, and fewer unhoused faces in their <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/nashville-public-library-fire-update/article_0a189d01-4ed3-44df-b22a-d73f0f873832.html">booming Business Improvement Districts</a>.</p><p>Last week Metro released the 2025 Point-in-Time (PIT) count for benchmarking how many people are unhoused year-over-year. The benchmark by definition undercounts how many people are unhoused on the one night a year it takes place, but it gives insight into how we are doing in addressing homelessness. This year, we’re up over 4%. A total of 2,180 people don’t have a place to live, and of the “unsheltered homeless”, 48% are categorized as “chronically homeless” (the people most in need of permanent supportive housing).</p><div

exist. That’s the process that is meant to ethically place those &gt;2,180 people in homes. That process doesn’t work if you throw it out the window every time the <a href="https://www.visitmusiccity.com/nashville-events/exclusive-fireworks-viewing-experience">Nashville Convention &amp; Visitors Corp.</a> realizes they might accidentally set the riverfront on fire.</p><p>But this isn’t about one bad decision, or one last minute “we forked up.” But Metro can’t exactly claim they’re calling a mulligan on this particular crisis when it’s becoming business as usual. The problem with this situation is that it shows a creeping normalization of bypassing process. And it’s easy to bypass process when you have no one powerful enough to check you for not doing it.</p><p>While it’s not unusual for Continuums of Care to house multiple roles in a single organization, Nashville’s model stands out for one key reason: all those roles now reside within local government, which have powerful conflicts of interest to doing things by-the-book, and virtually no effective community oversight. That structure may streamline control—but it severely limits accountability. </p><p>And it’s bad systems design. Elinor Ostrom, who won the Nobel Prize for her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Research">groundbreaking research</a>, showed that communities often manage shared resources—what’s called “commons”—more effectively than centralized control when they follow specific principles of collective governance. These include clearly defined boundaries, participatory rule-making, accountability, and local enforcement. In contrast, overly centralized systems, even when well-intentioned, often lack the flexibility and trust necessary for sustainable outcomes. </p><p>The consolidation of all homelessness governance roles within Metro government runs counter to these principles—and, as Ostrom’s research suggests, breeds fragility and risks systems failure precisely because it sidelines the people most impacted.</p><p>The best you can ask for when authority is centralized is that it follow clear processes. But the problem is, when all authority is centralized, there’s no one who has the power to demand that accountability.<br><br>The thing is: the rules are clear. What’s missing is the political will to follow them. And I don’t see why politicians and bureaucrats with broad powers would, of their own accord, rein themselves in. Even if we ask very <em>very</em> nicely. I’ve seen for months now advocates in this space request that those who’ve gained considerable positional power over the homeless, far more than they had just a few years ago, <em>to act more accountably. </em></p><p>The response has been, effectively: “Can you bring me evidence of why I should have to do this?”</p><p>I think it’s very important to put requests for change on the record. To submit them through the proper channels of communication. But everything has its season, like petitions and strongly worded emails. The power of a petition is not in it being answered, but in showing that it has been ignored. And then to take the next appropriate steps.</p><p>Let’s ground ourselves in the words of those who we may claim as our ancestors if we live to follow their words.<br></p><blockquote><p><strong>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.</strong><br>— Frederick Douglas</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.</strong><br>— Audre Lorde</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.</strong><br>— Martin Luther King, Jr.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Nobody in the world, nobody in history, has ever gotten their freedom by appealing to the moral sense of the people who were oppressing them.</strong><br>— Assata Shakur</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Power never takes a back step—only in the face of more power.</strong><br>— Malcolm X</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Power can be taken, but not given. The process of the taking is empowerment in itself.</strong><br>— Gloria Steinem</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.</strong><br>— Elie Wiesel</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Power grows from organization . . . Freedom is never given. It must be taken. And therefore you only get what you are organized to take!</strong><br>— National Union of the Homeless</p></blockquote><p></p><p>If the goal is to end homelessness, then the path forward isn’t selective urgency—it’s consistent accountability. That comes by honoring Coordinated Entry and enhancing its effectiveness, not by ignoring its very existence. Coordinated Entry is the social contract that binds all homeless response. It is the ethical connective tissue that separates a system that is doing its best (usually with the least) from a pool of patronage-rewarding resources that are doled out to engender deference, compliance, and allegiance.</p><p>But that is going to require changes of posture in how people show up in this space.<br><br>And that starts with providers setting a new standard: </p><div class="preformatted-block" data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><label class="hide-text" contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class="text"><strong>“Sure, I’ll help you close an encampment — If you place them in the permanent housing that you got $50 million for construction and support services for. Otherwise, they’re not moving—and neither am I.”</strong></pre></div><p></p><div><hr></div><p>More to come soon, including a community platform for reviewing OHS financial records. Other cities, like Atlanta, have this built into their normal data.gov platforms, but for now we’ll have to bootstrap it.
