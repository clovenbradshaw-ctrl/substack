<p>On Wednesday, June 4, several hundred individuals—including workers from the broader network of homelessness services, Metro Nashville employees and officials, members of the media, and independent writers like myself—gathered for the Office of Homeless Services (OHS) “State of Homelessness Symposium.”</p><p>The event opened with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aGt4mDxsDHOXM_UkhXbJfcBUmqG4dXJ_/view?usp=sharing">“community guidelines,”</a> distributed to attendees and reiterated from the stage, aimed at creating a “safe space.” These included reminders to “value a diversity of views and opinions” and to “critique ideas, not people.”</p><p>It seems those rules didn’t apply to the OHS Director’s opening remarks.</p><p>Referring to recent media criticism of her department, Director April Calvin thanked attendees for showing up despite “false narratives, fake news, and misleading facts.”</p><p>Many of the people she implicitly dismissed—including myself—were sitting in that room.</p><p>This sort of rhetoric, feeling more like an audition for Trumpworld than an act of leadership and tone-setting, was jarring. Especially because recent reporting critical of OHS doesn’t present new revelations to those familiar with Nashville’s homelessness services. Instead, it echoes longstanding concerns.</p><div><hr></div><p></p><p><a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/citylimits/former-homeless-impact-division-staff-say-agency-has-shifted-to-reactionary-closures/article_586d356c-ca71-11ec-9360-d3207b13a103.html">In 2022, the </a><em><a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/citylimits/former-homeless-impact-division-staff-say-agency-has-shifted-to-reactionary-closures/article_586d356c-ca71-11ec-9360-d3207b13a103.html">Nashville Scene</a></em> reported on several resignations from OHS’ predecessor, the Metro Homeless Impact Division (MHID), under Metro Social Services. The resignations came as Metro prepared to close an encampment under the Jefferson Street Bridge.</p><p>Rachel Cook, Shanley Deignan, and Lizzie Goddard—three staffers who resigned—warned against replicating *****<strong>INTRO HOUSTON IN PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH IF REFERENCING****** </strong>Houston’s encampment closure strategy, citing stark differences in local resources. As the Scene noted: “In 2020, Houston had an estimated $42 million in Continuum of Care grants compared to Nashville’s $6 million, and 4,000 more permanent supportive housing units.”</p><p>The three described new leadership as resistant to internal expertise and increasingly reactive to public pressure, especially on encampments. They were stunned when MHID announced it would attempt to house every resident of the Jefferson Street camp and then shutter it. Unlike Houston, Nashville simply didn’t have the resources to make that work.</p><p>At the time, Calvin, then MHID’s assistant director, acknowledged communication missteps but emphasized a “data-focused approach” and expressed optimism. Mayor John Cooper had just pledged $50 million from the American Rescue Plan toward homelessness efforts.</p><p><strong>Three years on</strong>, that $50 million has largely been spent. Yet Nashville still lacks a robust stock of permanent supportive housing (PSH) for people leaving encampments like Old Tent City. Over 100 people were moved to the Rodeway Inn, but the vast majority have no PSH to transition into. Compounding the problem, HUD housing vouchers—essential for PSH—are currently paused, and may well disappear entirely.</p><p>And that data-driven approach Calvin once promised? It remains unconvincing to many in the field. There’s deep skepticism about the data OHS collects—numbers that drive the city’s homelessness strategy. How many PSH units exist? How many unhoused people died last year? How many retained housing? These are basic yet vital questions, and the answers are murky.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

twice:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[5:19]</strong> “I thank you all that dismiss the false narratives, fake news, and misleading facts…”<br><strong>[9:41]</strong> “We’re also committed to working diligently even while we have to drown out some of the news, the fake news…”</p></blockquote><p>Multiple service providers told me that while Calvin has previously referred to criticism as “propaganda,” this was their first time hearing her say “fake news.”</p><p>After her speech, I spoke with Director Calvin. She initially greeted me cordially. I responded by expressing frustration at being labeled “fake news,” especially given that her office had declined opportunities to comment on my article before publication—despite knowing when it was scheduled to run.</p><p>When I asked if she was referring to my work, she confirmed she was. But not just mine, she added—other critical coverage, too, was apparently riddled with “lies.”</p><p>She didn’t cite any specific inaccuracies. “There’s just too much wrong,” she said. “It’s not worth going into.”</p><p>I told her that, in my view, it’s dangerous for public officials to dismiss unflattering reporting as “fake news.”</p><p>“You know what’s dangerous, Mike?” she replied.</p><p>“Please, what is?”</p><p>“Writing things that are 75 percent lies. That’s dangerous.”</p><p>I ended our conversation by reiterating my openness to corrections. “Please send your fact checks,” I said while returning to my seat. I haven’t received any. </p><p>So far, the only public comment from OHS appears to be “fake news.”</p><div><hr></div><h3>Critique Enhances Performance. Incorporating it gracefully and transparency builds trust.</h3><p></p><p>I spent a few days considering how to respond to this. I didn’t want to make this about me. <a href="https://nashville.citycast.fm/podcasts/council-comments-go-viral-marsha-going-after-freddie-and-old-tent-city-gone">On </a><em><a href="https://nashville.citycast.fm/podcasts/council-comments-go-viral-marsha-going-after-freddie-and-old-tent-city-gone">City Cast Nashville</a></em>, Commissioner Whitney Pastorek addressed the “fake news” label directly. Her show, which had featured both me and the Chair of the Executive Committee of the Homelessness Planning Council, Kennetha Patterson, had also covered OHS critically—and also received no response from the office despite repeated requests for comment.</p><p>I get it. I’ve been on the other side of the story. When I worked in the Mayor’s Office of Community Safety, we received tough media coverage. It was frustrating. But I understood the media wasn’t always there to pat us on the back. We had a full-time comms person for that. As does Director Calvin.</p><p>Criticism is part of the system. Not to tear it down, but to make it better.</p><p>Despite the Symposium’s community guidelines asking everyone to “value a diversity of views and opinions” this wasn’t modeled on the day. And not just by Director Calvin. </p><p>Another speaker, <a href="https://whova.com/web/rFS78mFzzpHONn5R7WJ5UKpARukcP1HrHDsN1JsaLIY%3D/">Ethan Frizzell,</a> a Major in the Salvation Army, lectured on how when the broader homelessness ecosystem handled disagreements publicly rather than privately, it puts, he argues, the potential for solving the homelessness epidemic at risk.

OHS is a data-producing agency. Its numbers shape how Nashville responds to homelessness. If its data isn’t trustworthy, if it lacks transparency, the entire system suffers. </p><p>I was talking with a senior Metro official about this situation, and they told me that increasingly people are cancelling meetings with Director Calvin. I think it’s really unfortunate that trust has been lost in the system and that communication is breaking down. But it’s not going to be repaired by calling those who speak critically liars, without engaging in the content of their claims.</p><p>Before June 4, I gave OHS the benefit of the doubt. There’s always more to a story. *****But they’re unwilling to share their side of it and yet argue that other points of view are acting entirely in bad faith.**** If that’s not failing to “value a diversity of views and opinions” and to “critique ideas, not people,” I don’t know what is.</p><p>If I got something wrong, if my ideas about what’s happening in this space are drastically off base, I <em>need</em> to know. I’ll correct it. I’ve published corrections before—proactively. I take that seriously. Because trust is earned. And it’s earned through honesty, not defensiveness.</p><p>If I’ve misunderstood the system, misread data, or been misled—<em><strong>let me know</strong></em>. I’ll own it. But I need something more than a vague accusation of my own untrustworthiness. </p><p>The fact is Director Calvin is right: It is dangerous to spread falsehoods about something this important. <strong>But it’s just as dangerous to leave falsehoods uncorrected.</strong></p><p>DELETE: So again, Director Calvin and OHS: Please tell me where I’ve erred.
