<p>The employer of a detainee from this weekend’s <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2025/05/05/families-searching-loved-ones-after-ice-raids-south-nashville/">ICE raid in Nashville</a> was able to make contact with him while in detention. This is the first known instance where one of the detainees from the joint operation with Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE has been able to speak about their experience.</p><p>The detainee’s name, current detention facility, and the info of the person who spoke with them have been redacted for their safety. The person who spoke with the detainee gave permission for this to be shared as redacted.</p><p>The detainee, “Alex”, was finally reached after being taken on Saturday while traveling on Nolensville Pike. Prior to reaching him by phone on Tuesday, this was the last anyone knew of Alex’s whereabouts, detailed by his employer.</p><blockquote><p>[Alex fue detenido] en nolensville pike cercas del zoo/bucanas, pararon a su primo y la novia donde [Alex] iva de passenger atras. Solo [Alex] fue detenido, y fue la ultima vez que supimos de el.</p><p>[Alex was arrested] on Nolensville Pike near the Zoo / [the club] Bucanas. They stopped his cousin and his girlfriend, with [Alex] riding in the back seat. Only [Alex] was arrested, and that was the last time we heard from him.</p></blockquote><p>ICE provided no information about where Alex went, as is their policy. Nor would they even confirm he was detained. Only by searching his name and country of origin repeatedly on https://locator.ice.gov was he able to be found.</p><p>But finding someone in the system does not give you the ability to communicate with them.</p><p>In order to contact a detainee, you must have their Alien Registration Number (A#), or else the private detainment facilities, run by multi-billion-dollar corporations like Geo Group <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GEO/">NYSE: GEO</a>, do not let you contact them — or even confirm that they are there.</p><p>As I experienced first hand, the operators at the detention facilities send you to ICE if you don’t have the detainee’s A#. </p><p>But ICE is unwilling to provide that information, claiming it is confidential, and that only the detainee can share it — the detainee who may not be given any access to a phone (and therefore an attorney) during the crucial time when they are first detained and need to make decisions about whether or not to request a detention hearing.</p><p>Here’s my conversation with a detention center operator asking how to get the A# to order to check if a detainee was there on behalf of their family. They sent me to locator.ice.gov, which does not provide this info, and to a phone number (318-992-1600) that goes to a non-professional sounding voicemail that never picked up or returned my call.</p><p>The operator acknowledged that “they just give us that number to give when people want more information.”</p><p>I asked: “Do people ever call you and say, ‘hey, they never called me back?’”</p><p>Operator: “They call me and say that all the time. And I just let them know there’s nothing I can do about it.”</p><p>Alex’s employer was able to deposit money into his commissary and credits for a phone call, and they got in touch.</p><p>The experiences he details are very alarming.</p><p>He was pressured to agree to his own deportation or  “things were going to get worse for them. They would be in jail for up to a year or longer,” and scared by this prospect he signed the document. This happened <em>before</em> he was allowed to telephone anyone, including a lawyer.<br><br>An immigration lawyer I spoke to characterized pressuring someone to agree to their own self deportation, especially without the ability to contact an attorney, as “illegal and unethical.” </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Patrol’s account of the immigration enforcement action. THP has defended the 150 traffic stops within a small radius over several hours as “<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2025/05/04/nashville-ice-activity-immigrant-rights-group-protest/83448382007/">a public safety operation</a>” and that these were legitimate traffic enforcement actions.</p><p>Alex detailed to his employer about what happened when the car he was riding in was pulled over.</p><blockquote><p>The officer immediately asked all the people in the car if they were legal. Alex didn’t answer and he said the officer immediately said well i guess that means you’re illegal (along those lines) and that’s when they detained him.</p></blockquote><p>Alex alleges that he suffered additional injustices. Having just been paid by his employer he had somewhere between $1,700 and 1,800 on him at the time of his detainment. Upon transferring from one facility to another, the money was allegedly missing from his wallet.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png" width="1208" height="480" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;width&quot;:1208,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:142551,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/163057954?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOl2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f0c6be5-58c4-4503-8e7a-8ffda238ca5d_1208x480.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Alex may well have had a path to staying in this country.
