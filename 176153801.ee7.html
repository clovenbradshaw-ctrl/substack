<h1></h1><div><hr></div><h1>Complexity As Enemy</h1><p>Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner in December 2021 for $28.3 billion, and the deal closed June 2022. Oracle inherited a mess that had been decades in the making. The Department of Veterans Affairs had long struggled with incompatible medical record systems — one for the VA, another for the Department of Defense, and countless customized versions across individual hospitals. Each site had spent years tweaking its local database to fit its own workflows and needs, creating what could be described as “dialects” of data. These systems functioned internally but broke down the moment information had to travel.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Connect the World</strong></h2><p>Think about how you’d solve this problem: everyone speaks different languages and needs to communicate.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Fragmentation</strong> Everyone just... doesn’t communicate. The French hospital has French records. The German hospital has German records. If you get sick in Germany after treatment in France, the doctors start from scratch. This is where American healthcare was—and largely still is. Without using the same electronic health record system in the same way, and/or doing very careful translation between systems, your cardiologist in Boston and your surgeon in New York might as well be from different planets.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Centralization (Oracle’s Way)</strong> Build one massive translation headquarters. Everyone must send their messages through this single building, where everything gets converted into One Universal Language.</p><p>But here’s the problem: computers aren’t like humans.</p><p>When a human doctor reads “patient allergic to penicillin” and another chart says “penicillin allergy documented,” they understand these mean the same thing. They can handle “Tylenol,” “acetaminophen,” and “paracetamol” as the same drug. They know “Dr. Smith, Cardiology, Building 3” and “J. Smith, MD - Cardiac Services, Medical Plaza” might be the same person.</p><p>Normal computer programs can’t do this. They need EXACTLY the same words, in EXACTLY the same format, in EXACTLY the same fields.</p><p>One hospital’s database stores a prescription as:</p><pre><code><code>MEDICATION: “Acetaminophen 500mg”
PATIENT_ID: “VA-2847362”
LOCATION: “Pharmacy-Building-A”</code></code></pre><p>Another hospital stores it as:</p><pre><code><code>DRUG_NAME: “Tylenol 500mg” 
VETERAN_ID: “2847362-VA”
DEPT: “Bldg A Pharmacy”</code></code></pre><p>To a human, these are obviously the same thing. To a computer, they’re completely incompatible. Even tiny differences—a dash vs. a hyphen, a space vs. an underscore—make records unmatchable.</p><p>This isn’t a minor technical nuance. It’s life-and-death. If the system can’t match “Building A Pharmacy” to “Pharmacy-Building-A,” the prescription order goes nowhere. The veteran doesn’t get their medication. And unlike humans who would notice something seems wrong, the computer just... proceeds as if everything is fine.</p><p>A stop gap solution often presented for problems like this is to task it to AI to just figure it out. Large language models can understand context far better than normal computer systems — but they’re also know to <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html">make things up</a>. </em>When the name of prescription is the difference between life and death, leaving it to a system that fundamentally does not understand what <em>truth</em> is is not a good option.</p><p><strong>What Actually Happened at the VA</strong></p><p>When Oracle took over veterans’ healthcare records with a $16 billion contract, Larry Ellison promised to end the chaos. No more islands. One system, one database, one truth. Every VA hospital, clinic, and pharmacy would speak the same language through Oracle’s central hub.</p><p>The theory was elegant: force everyone to use exactly the same data format. One schema to rule them all. When a doctor in Spokane orders a lab test, it arrives in exactly the same format as an order from Columbus. Perfect standardization.</p><p>But here’s what centralized systems do when they encounter the inevitable exceptions—when the real world doesn’t match the perfect schema:</p><p>In 2022, investigators discovered something chilling. When Oracle’s system encountered information it couldn’t translate—things like a prescription format that was slightly different, a department name that didn’t exactly match its master list, a patient location that used the old naming convention—it didn’t flag an error. It didn’t ask for human help. It just quietly dropped these medical orders into what staff called the “unknown queue.”</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png" width="1024" height="1536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1536,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3653819,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/175062068?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5NjM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4738b4c5-0226-4093-9f4c-a8e4b2086cd0_1024x1536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>An invisible trash bin where over 11,000 orders for veteran care simply disappeared. Lab tests. Specialist referrals. Prescriptions. The system treated them like spam email—filtered them out silently because they didn’t match the expected pattern exactly.</p><p>The computer saw something like:</p><pre><code><code>LOCATION: “Cardiology-Clinic-3”</code></code></pre><p>But its database only recognized things like:</p><pre><code><code>LOCATION: “Cardiac-Services-Building-3”</code></code></pre><p>No match. Order deleted. No alert sent. 149 veterans were harmed.</p><p>The software could prove data had entered the system, but not that the <em>meaning</em> survived the journey. A human would have known “Cardiology Clinic 3” and “Cardiac Services Building 3” were the same place. The computer saw gibberish and threw it away.</p><p>This is centralization’s core failure: it <em>demands</em> perfect conformity in a messy world. When hospitals had been using their own systems for decades—each with their own department names, their own patient ID formats, their own medication codes—Oracle’s solution was to force everything into one rigid schema. What didn’t fit perfectly? Into the void it went.</p><p>Staff at VA hospitals figured this out and started running informal parallel systems: writing things down on paper, making phone calls to verify orders actually went through, manually checking queues the software said were empty. The old workarounds they thought they were escaping.</p><p>Oracle made the system <em>look</em> simple. But they did it by treating human language and medical complexity like a data-entry problem that just needed stricter rules. When reality didn’t match the schema, reality got censored.</p><p><strong>Option 3: Federation (The Thing They Won’t Build)</strong></p><p>Here’s the approach they <em>could</em> take, and it’s based on how humans actually communicate, and how complex natural systems actually work.</p><p>When you meet someone who speaks another language, you don’t demand they learn your exact dialect. You find common ground, use context, maybe a translator who understands <em>both</em> languages. But you preserve the meaning even if the exact words change.</p><p>A federated system would work the same way: let each hospital keep its own “dialect”—its own database structure, its own terminology, its own workflows that evolved for good reasons over decades. But give every patient a universal identity—a secure thread that connects all their records, wherever they were created, in the context they were created.</p><p>Instead of forcing hospitals to speak Oracle’s language, build translation layers that understand context. When “Cardiology Clinic 3” needs to talk to “Cardiac Services Building 3,” the system would recognize these refer to the same place—the way a human would. The translation happens at the edges, preserving local meaning, not forcing everything through a central bottleneck that demands perfect conformity.</p><p>The patient becomes the connecting thread. Their medical history is an event stream <em>they</em> control and grant access to. When you arrive at a new hospital, your records flow to them directly, translated contextually, not converted to a universal schema that loses nuance.</p><p>Think about email: Gmail and Outlook don’t force you to use the same format. They translate at the edges. Your email doesn’t pass through one central server that demands everyone structure their messages identically. It’s federated—different systems, compatible protocols, preserved meaning.</p><p>The internet itself works this way. It’s not one big computer. It’s millions of computers speaking compatible protocols, translating at the edges, preserving local control.</p><h3><strong>Why Oracle Won’t Build This</strong></h3><p>Because it’s not a good business model.</p><p>If your product is not the central hub that all patient care must flow through, it’s hard to charge $16 billion. If you’re just providing translation tools at the edges instead of controlling the master database, you lose leverage.</p><p>And here’s the deeper incentive: Larry Ellison explicitly stated Oracle’s goal was to build a “unified national health records database” that aggregates all patient data for AI development and population health insights. You can’t do that in a federated system where patients control access to their own data streams. You need centralization. You need to be the hub where all information accumulates.</p><p>Oracle treated complexity as a defect to be eliminated through perfect standardization. But medical care is irreducibly complex—full of context, exceptions, and human judgment. What was needed was a system that could <em>navigate</em> that complexity, preserve meaning across translation, and keep humans in the loop when computers inevitably encounter something they can’t perfectly match.</p><p>Instead, they got a system that made complexity invisible by deleting it.</p><blockquote><p>“…The cardinal sin of the computing industry is the creation of complexity.”<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2014/10/09/complex-business-challenges-require-simple-tech-solutions/">Larry Ellison</a></p></blockquote><h1><strong>Complexity as God</strong></h1><p>At the core of the problem with the VA is the same problem at the core of all of Ellison’s ambition — <strong>complexity</strong>.</p><p>Complexity is what escapes the limits of the human mind’s containment.

ends — in theology, in chaos, in the places where prediction fails. This is where all systems of control break down. Where we see that the ontology of the <em>spreadsheet </em>and the <em>SQL database</em> and the <em>data graph</em> all fall short of describing that which <em>is — </em>because beings don’t all exist as static 1s and 0s that <em>are </em>or <em>are not. </em>Beings, the things we’d like to measure and control, all exist along a mysterious spectrum of being-ness. Some indeed are solid and definable, the billiard balls of the Newtonian universe. </p><p>Other things though escape precise observation: the animal spirits of the market, the electron, the culture of an office space, the emotional content of our loved ones — to quantify them is to crush them, and to have them re-form as a swarm beyond any comprehension. When we try to mark and measure these things that resist being named, they begin naming us, and <em>pursue us</em> like the furies in Aeschylus.</p><p>And then there are the things most interesting of all, that exist in the phase space between thing and <em>not thing.</em> The protagonists of the world that both exhibit chaos and order, that cannot be contained, but need to be structurally nurtured into their fullness, ever evolving to become what they are, ever <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/54g8ae/the_right_way_to_interpret_aristotles/">being-at-work-staying-themselves</a>.</em></p><p>All of these in the Oracle database are flattened static cells and nodes to be variously served and/or exploited. It’s not that using technology and knowledge is futile, but it is the ambition to use to circumvent the immutable laws of existence that is futile — <em>that is what it means to be a TechnoFutilist.</em></p><p>To engage with the true complexity of the universe is to confront what is larger than us. To master it, as Ellison seeks to, is to play God — but only as imitation, as cosplay, <em>not as incarnation.</em></p><div><hr></div><h1>The True Oracle</h1><p>Wanting to know everything isn’t an inherently bad thing. But it gets dangerous when you don’t want to accept the spiritual lessons that come from realizing this <em>isn’t possible.</em></p><p>There are many traditions that chart the path toward divine understanding, towards <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta">god consciousness</a></em>. The East’s <em>Advaita Vedanta</em> teaches <em>Jnana Yoga</em> — the union of knowledge and realization. The West’s <em>Platonic Idealism</em> ascends toward the One, the Good beyond comprehension. But both begin in reason and end in surrender. The rational mind can approach the divine, but it cannot possess it. The path demands that we find the limit of intellect and take the leap beyond it with faith.</p><p>In Dante’s <em>Purgatorio</em> (the sequel to <em>The Inferno</em> if you weren’t aware) the Roman poet Virgil guide up the spiraling path of redemption, leaves him at the gates of <em>Paradise </em>(the third book in the series). Dante has arrived there not through accumulating power, banishing suffering, hoarding knowledge, or seizing control, but through gaining sovereignty over <em>his own soul.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png" width="1205" height="237" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:237,&quot;width&quot;:1205,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61283,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/175062068?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea3d7dd2-e8c4-4b42-a986-69c6840ce1f1_1408x600.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fmfL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33c43851-01f6-498f-a255-e94d221c0cf4_1205x237.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Ellison’s dream of conquest through knowledge — his ambition to gather all data in one place, to build a modern Library of Alexandria — is only the latest incarnation of a very old temptation. The author of <em>Ecclesiastes</em> saw the futility of that quest centuries before the first line of code:</p><blockquote><p>“There is no new thing under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 1:9)<br>“For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.” (Ecclesiastes 1:18)</p></blockquote><p>And more to the point:</p><blockquote><p><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night— <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.<br>(Ecclesiastes 8:16–17)</p></blockquote><p>The Preacher’s lament could have been written for our age of databases and machine learning. The more we seek to comprehend the whole, the more we discover how little of it we truly hold. Knowledge folds back upon itself until it becomes grief — the grief of realizing that the map, however perfect, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">can never become the territory</a>.</p><p>Ellison’s war on complexity — his dream of one schema to rule all others — is not just a technical crusade but a metaphysical reenactment of that ancient desire to make mystery submit to mastery. It is the will to collapse creation into comprehension, to replace faith with architecture.</p><p>Yet, as <em>Ecclesiastes</em> reminds us, even the wisest man cannot “find out the work that is done under the sun.” Complexity is not a flaw in creation; <em>it is the texture of it.</em> It is what keeps the world alive instead of frozen, relational instead of rigid.</p><p>Ellison’s fixation on Japanese feudal and warrior culture did not seem to leave any lasting traces of Zen buddhism on him. </p><blockquote><p>Death has never made any sense to me. How can a person be there and then just vanish, just not be there? Death makes me very angry.</p><p><a href="https://www.preachingtoday.com/illustrations/2021/january/larry-ellison-death-makes-me-angry.html">-Larry Ellison</a></p></blockquote><p>Born a prince, a prophesy foretold that the young Siddhartha Gautama would either be a great king or a spiritual leader. Sheltered away from the suffering of life, one day he strolled outside his palace and saw a person ravaged by age, another sickened by illness, a corpse overcome by death, and a wandering man seeking god. For six years he sought enlightenment — and found that at its core what held humanity back from it was clinging to our suffering and not accepting it.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering. In brief, the five containers of clinging are suffering.</p><p>— Samyutta Nikaya 56.11 (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta)</p></div><p>Early Buddhism was contemporaneous with Taoism, built around the teaching of Laozi<em>, </em>who is said to have written <em>Tao Te Ching</em> to gain passage out of China, an empire he saw in decline in the 3rd of 4th century BC.

Espionage and natural philosophy were as alive then as today. But the ancient world valued something far more than information<em>. </em>They valued <em>wisdom.</em></p><p>There in Delphi, a secluded holy ground 180 km from Athens, priestesses breathed deep from intoxicating fumes rising up from the earth (something confirmed by a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gaseous-emissions-at-orac/">team of American researchers in 2001</a>) and are said to have spoken in the voice of Apollo, the god of healing and prophesy.</p><p>Chaerephon, whose name means bearer of joy, has travelled to the temple at Delphi to ask a question about his friend. He asked the priestess if a man he knew back in Athens really was <em>the wisest man alive.</em></p><p>The priestess, known now as <em>The Oracle, </em>said that indeed, <em>no one was wiser.</em></p><p>This did not make sense to Socrates.</p><p>“What can the god mean?” Socrates asked when the joyful Chaepheron relayed the message from the Oracle, “I know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What then can she mean by saying I am the wisest?”</p><p>Socrates went out to disprove the Oracle. </p><p>He began conversing with the most respected leaders in his city, Athens. The orators and the philosophers and business leaders and politicians. And in every dialogue with them, he found something strange. The great men of his city, when you asked them to explain what they knew and how they knew it, eventually their reasons and beliefs all just <em>fell apart. </em>Athens was full of great minds and better speakers, but on examination, Socrates found, it was all <em>a</em> lot of sound and fury, <em>signifying nothing. </em></p><p>And it was then that Socrates realized the Oracle was right. Socrates <em>was the wisest.</em> But in a perverse way. He was the wisest because he knew the only thing there is to know: <em>the he knew nothing.</em></p><p>In 1977 the United State’s Central Intelligence Agency wanted to build a database that was capable of “answering any question.”</p><p>They wanted to build it using a new form of information organizing called a “relational database.” They hired the firm of Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates to build them this tool for a simple purpose: to create a database that could store all the world’s information such that it could be <em>asked anything.</em></p><p>Ellison, Miner and Oates did not invent the relational database. They stood on the shoulders of giants, knew a market gap when they saw one, and built the first commercial relational database — laying the foundation for the future of the information age. They asked the only question that the god of capitalism ever asks: <em>how can we sell this?</em></p><p>What they did not ask, not deeply at least, is: </p><blockquote><p>What kind of information can this <em>not encode</em>? <br>And what kind of questions can this <em>not answer</em>?</p></blockquote><p>To this day, the <em>TechnoFutilist</em>s, Larry Ellison preeminent among them, believe the database can answer any question. The technology and theory has been upgraded. Silicon does things at scales no one truly imagined possible, graph and network databases encode complex relationship better than the original relational databases ever could. But something is decidedly <em>absent</em> from what the database transmutes into cells and nodes and edges.</p><p>The CIA wanted a machine that could tell them anything, especially the future. And that’s what Larry Ellison tried to build them, and it is what he is still selling them. It’s what he’s selling Nashville — the future, <em>if only you give me the server space to encode it.</em> </p><p>And if predicting “the future” involves, perhaps, creating a list of people that could targeted because <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/10/trump-classifies-anti-capitalism-as-a-political-pre-crime">they are guilty of “</a><em><a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/10/trump-classifies-anti-capitalism-as-a-political-pre-crime">pre-crimes</a>” </em>based on the information their database has stored on them, then indeed, Ellison and his company may be able to deliver.</p><p>But if the point is to accomplish the goals that Ellison has set out for himself, <em>to end human suffering, to cure cancer so that he may be loved, and thereby happy, </em>this is not something any database or technology company can provide. And building a centralized database of human activity that is all too easily used to track political rivals and identify “undesirables” is no way to reduce suffering — it is quite, quite the opposite.</p><p>The path to ending human suffering is not through information, no matter how centralized it is. Ellison is open about wanting to concentrate power by absorbing all the world’s information. And he may get it, and Nashville may help him, but it will never make him feel loved. And it will never make us safer.</p><p>The true Oracle, the one who said the Socrates was the wisest man in the world, knew that the desire to know all things was the greatest form of ignorance mankind could attain.</p><p>And now, in the Athens of the South, we are building a billion dollar shrine to our ignorance. And as always, it will be those with the least who will pay the real cost. <em>But, rejoice, fellow Athenian, we are getting a new pedestrian bridge!</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png" width="1000" height="1000" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:379051,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/175062068?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mT0L!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c141b5-af35-4ed2-ad27-6d2ac4a2be9c_1000x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div>
