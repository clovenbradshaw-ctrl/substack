paper trails to light this spring and summer. Publicly available information isn’t always easy to get, often demanding litigious email followups and specifically worded requests, and Lacy’s prolific Substack posts about the city’s hapless Office of Homeless Services proved that obsession can be repurposed for the public good. His “OHS Community Audit” webpage paved the way for Metro’s own examination, and his newsletter promises even more well-designed data dumps to come.</p></blockquote><p>There’s something really special about winning an award for a thing you didn’t even know you were nominated for. I’d be lying if I said this didn’t make me feel very warm and fuzzy, and really hopeful for the future of our city and democracy at large.<br><br>Thank you to <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Eli Motycka&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:4007056,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c253e82-f96e-4e90-97dd-540517ba0529_512x512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;7b240056-3261-4db3-b57e-cdca7e9f5aac&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> for the very kind write up.

To face our oncoming disasters and miraculous opportunities, we’ll need  infinitely more voices to join the spiral of collective self-awareness.</p><p>I really still am not making any meaningful money doing this.

It means I have to cover editing, fact checking, and litigation defense insurance in-house, but it also means no one can say <em>maybe you don’t publish this, or else…</em></p><p>Something I’ve learned a lot about, and should save for a memoir of sorts, is the power of not caring about what’s called in the media biz “access”. Over the course of this work I’ve gotten the phone numbers of some important people relevant to what I’m covering, but I’ve seen how that is more of a tool for them than it is for me. </p><p>Very little of the important information we’ve discussed on here has come from the mouths and text messages of “powerful people” — it’s almost exclusively come from public information that people tried very hard to make not public, and from members of the public themselves. </p><p>I think this is a very important lesson that true power is, and always shall be, <em>with the people. </em>And that if people have an ambition to be powerful, it is <em>they</em> who need to find ways to <em>access the people</em>.</p><p>I’ve definitely pissed a lot of people off doing this work, exposed some things that sting, and made people face up to truths they thought they were not ready to handle. Some people do this kinda work fueled by the anger of haters, but that’s not why I’m in this.</p><p>It is honestly a heavy burden to me knowing that people feel harmed by the things I have brought to light, even though a healthy democracy requires it. I do believe that to many of the people I’ve written about, their <em>emotional truth</em> is they feel attacked. </p><p>This is partly why I opt to try to get resolution outside of public disclosure whenever possible. I’m not in this to <em>break stories</em>, I’m in this to break down the blockages that are making our systems not work for the people they’re meant to serve. </p><p>I’ve published 90 articles on Substack. But my Drafts folder is just as large. It’s not a great business model. But hey, apparently it wins you awards.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png" width="674" height="134" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:134,&quot;width&quot;:674,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:17804,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/175721122?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8cSr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46a863e8-c33b-4a39-ba0e-b94f37c4a426_674x134.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There is a contingent of folks, many of whom I’m good friends with, who don’t see why it is ever worth holding back the wrath of public shaming whenever possible. </p><p>This is where I don’t know if “journalist” is the right term for me, because really I am someone who is just drawn to problems, and wants to solve them — and becoming skilled in data science and investigative journalism has been a means to an end.</p><p>My ethos is inspired by a much less problematic president than Jefferson.
