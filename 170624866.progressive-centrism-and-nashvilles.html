But when it comes to the quagmire we’ve found ourselves in in Middle Tennessee, the laboratory of experimenting with simultaneous de-regulation and authoritarian control over people’s lives, we don't have the luxury of waiting for hindsight. We live at intersection of <em>fucking around </em>and <em>finding out</em>, but even though academia does its best to tell us what our actions (e.g. mass forced dis-enrollments from TennCare in 2005) lead to (<a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.00973">27.6% in evictions</a>), we never seem to <em>remember</em> what we find out.</p><p>And I think part of the the reason is because even in this “blue dot in a red state,” our leaders, in the Mayor’s Office, in academic institutions, at major philanthropies, at corporations, are not performing their function as self-defined “<em><strong>progressives</strong></em>” by any reasonable definition of that term. </p><p>An essential task of what a progressive must do is <em>remember</em>. And to intentionally build systems that prevent that (1) decentralize power, (2) empower communities, and (3) advance equity. Any political project that does not do these things, empowered by the lessons of the past and a bold vision of the future, is not <em>progressivism.</em> It is, at best, <em><strong>centrism</strong></em>, progress-nullifying position that, at nearly every turn, unintentionally accelerates the reactionary de-construction of civil society.</p><p>And looking at the actual track record of our institution in Middle Tennessee, <em>at best</em> most of them, including the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250623133701/https://www.readyforfreddie.com/about">truly progressive</a>” Mayor Freddie O’Connell, could be defined as <em>centrist</em> – the political identity that perpetuates the dangerous illusion that politics is merely a two dimensional battle between Left &amp; Right.</p><p>There’s a terribly boring and narcissistic tendency of centrist leaders to be afflicted with a victim complex that they are “misunderstood by both sides”. They are seen as either <em>too Left</em> or <em>too Right</em>. In this solipsistic view of the political landscape, the blame is put on <em>the extremes</em> — never on the limits of their own political imagination or undercooked interpretation of societal forces. </p><p>To the afflicted centrist, the world is comprised of: the screeching liberals on one side who demand solidarity with their socialist agendas, and the more reasonable and professional class (albeit with some genocidal tendencies) on the other side. The centrist sees it their it as their spiritual duty to be the cross bearer between these two extremes, moderating their tendencies for excess, drinking from the poisoned chalice of self-sacrifice, wiser than all, never getting enough credit.</p><p>It’s a logical enough interpretation of how you’re supposed to lead, for a 14 year old. Operating at Stage 10 (of 15) on the “<a href="https://metamoderna.org/what-is-the-mhc/">Model of Hierarchical Complexity</a>,” it makes decisions essentially adding together what everyone wants and “taking the average” (even though centrists virtually always stack the scales on the conservative side of the equation).</p><p>But the problem is that humans and politics are not two dimensional. To be effective, we need leaders with higher capacities of complexity in their thinking.</p><p>You cannot understand the real complexity of society and be a “progressive centrist” (and in fact you realize quickly the term in an oxymoron). When you imagine all political priorities as somewhere on the spectrum of Far Left vs Far Right, you are imagining a social and political landscape where no true progress is actually possible. If these agendas are cancelling each other out constantly thanks to your being able to “split the difference” then your function as centrist is to <em>nullify</em> all progress.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png" width="728" height="238.784" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:164,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:13325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/170624866?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98f32493-9f79-4d60-b112-cca1e6160fae_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lpew!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee5af08d-6ca9-48e2-abf0-9b1855a48b87_500x164.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>These flattened two dimensions, Left vs Right, they stop making any real sense as soon as you zoom in. For example, <em>Why is it a Right Wing thing to support rugged individualism, but a Left Wing thing to support bodily autonomy?</em> It’s because society and politics is <em>far more complicated</em> than the centrist wants them to be, there’s more variables and dimensions than they want them to hold, and their identity as the savior of us from our own extremes hinges on them confusing themselves on this matter.</p><p>Heeding Hegel’s warning that we can’t understand a moment while we’re in it, we still need to try to understand this delusion of "progressive centrism" while we're still trapped inside it, while the contradictions are still unfolding, while the machinery is still grinding people into the ground.</p><p>Centrism dresses itself in the language of balance, reason, and inclusivity. But when the ground shifts toward authoritarianism, that "balance" becomes a slow drift to the right. It doesn't hold the center — it moves it. If the authoritarian pole keeps pulling and the so-called "center" adjusts to remain between "both sides," the center is simply an obedient marker on someone else's map.</p><p>When centrism is mistaken for progressivism, it gives cover to policies that keep inequity in place while claiming moral high ground. When it's mistaken for leftism, the danger sharpens: the public believes progressive work is being done, when the machinery of change is actually running backward. That false confidence leaves space wide open for authoritarian forces to consolidate power without meaningful resistance.</p><p>False progressivism doesn't just fail — it fails in a way that pushes people toward the very forces it claims to oppose. When you call something leftism that's actually corporate-friendly centrism, you make real leftism look like a scam, and you hand the "time for a change" vote to the right on a silver platter.</p><h2><strong>What Progressivism Actually Means</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png" width="1456" height="1253" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1253,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cv5i!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8166e0bb-9831-4d44-b758-cf951aa59366_1580x1360.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I don't know what most leaders mean when they call themselves "truly progressive." But here's what I mean:</p><p><strong>Progressivism is structural reorganization toward shared power — irreversible transfers of agency from the few to the many.</strong></p><p>It doesn't politely manage existing hierarchies. It builds new ones that make the old ones obsolete. It costs the powerful something real — not symbolic gestures, but actual loss of control.</p><p>If the short-sighted elites embrace a "progressive" initiative, you're not looking at progressivism. You're looking at containment. Real progressivism would benefit them too in the long run — more stable societies, educated workforces, less social upheaval — but they can't see past quarterly earnings.</p><p>Real progressivism is self-replicating liberation: each win makes the next easier. Building infrastructure for dissent that doesn't need permission — legal defense funds, strike funds, independent media, mutual aid networks. Pragmatic about dismantling hierarchy, whether through elections, direct action, or parallel systems.</p><p>The test is simple:</p><ul><li><p>Does it decentralize power?</p></li><li><p>Does it advance equity?</p></li><li><p>Does it give communities real control?</p></li></ul><p>If the answer is no, it's not progressivism — it's PR.</p><h2><strong>The Brand vs. The Build</strong></h2><p>Words matter in politics, but they often have little relation to lived reality. That's why it's useful to separate the brand from the build:</p><p><strong>Brand</strong> is what leaders say they stand for.<br><strong>Build</strong> is what their policies actually produce.</p><p>Nashville perfected this split. The city brands itself as a "blue island in a sea of red" — progressive, welcoming, creative. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Mayoral_election_in_Nashville,_Tennessee_(2023)">Mayor Freddie O'Connell won with 64%</a> running as "the only truly progressive candidate." His <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2025/04/04/vanderbilt-poll-mayor-oconnell-keeps-earning-high-marks-nashvillians-align-on-issues-but-not-always-on-solutions%E2%80%AF/">67% approval rating</a> suggests the brand is working.</p><p>But let's look at what they're actually building.</p><h2><strong>Nashville: Progressive Aesthetics, Conservative Operations</strong></h2><h3><strong>The Pattern Revealed</strong></h3><p>Start with homelessness — the clearest view of how power treats the powerless.</p><p>When <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/04/11/old-tent-city-closure/">Metro's Office of Homeless Services gave Old Tent City residents 60 days' notice in March</a> to leave with virtually none of the $25M for permanent housing they they were given available to residents, they called it "trauma-informed." The 125 people living there got relocated to a motel — just in time for a $70 million waterfront development. The <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/office-homeless-services/news/city-prioritizes-safety-and-housing-during-pre-fourth-july-relocation-effort">July 4th sweep of 40 people from the East Bank</a>? "Last minute Fire Marshal safety requirements."</p><p>The pattern is clear: enforcement timed to development schedules and tourist seasons, wrapped in the language of care.</p><p>The Nashville Downtown Partnership takes it further. <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2025/07/16/critics-complain-metro-council-shadow-police-force-downtown-nashville/">Between 2023-2024, their publicly funded off-duty THP officers arrested 209 homeless people</a> for sitting on sidewalks or holding signs. The officers were explicitly instructed to leave tourists alone because "they're the ones bringing in revenue." As if a city that actually housed and supported its vulnerable wouldn't be infinitely more attractive to those same tourists.</p><p>But here's where it gets truly absurd: The Downtown Partnership is technically a nonprofit that's the primary vendor of another nonprofit called the District Management Corporation (DMC), which operates as a pass-through for "special assessment funds" from Metro Government. The DMC's board has 8 of their 12 members appointed by the Nashville Downtown Partnership. It's nonprofits all the way down.</p><p>According to Metro ordinance O98-1037, the DMC must annually submit their budget to Metro Council for review and approval. They've actually submitted budgets — but Council hasn't reviewed or approved them since 2004. Metro Finance hasn't followed the legally required process. For twenty years, tens of millions of dollars have flowed through this system with zero actual oversight. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/621774641">The CEO makes $485,196 a year</a> from what are essentially mandatory taxes — call them "special assessments" if it makes you feel better, but if you don't pay, you face the same legal consequences as tax evasion.</p><p>This is what centrism looks like. Mandatory sales tax for the poor. No oversight for the wealthy.</p><h3><strong>The Institutional Architecture of Hypocrisy</strong></h3><p><strong>Vanderbilt University</strong> exemplifies this disconnect at its most sophisticated. Despite a <a href="https://www.pionline.com/endowments-and-foundations/vanderbilt-university-endowment-returns-92-fiscal-year">$10.2 billion endowment</a> and endless diversity statements, Vanderbilt pays service workers <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2021/11/18/new-three-year-contract-for-campus-service-workers-negotiated-between-the-university-and-vanderbilt-works-union/">$16.50 per hour</a> — roughly 65% of <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/47037">Nashville's living wage of $25.41</a>. These workers, predominantly immigrants and people of color, work second jobs and commute from outside Davidson County because they can't afford to live where they clean and cook.</p><p>When <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/10/10/vanderbilt-grad-students-look-for-increased-pay-better-benefits-with-united-auto-workers/">graduate students attempted unionization in 2024</a>, Vanderbilt hired Littler Mendelson, the world's largest anti-union law firm. The university declared that "graduate students do not meet the definition of 'employee'" — this about the people conducting research that generates millions in revenue. Meanwhile, the Board of Trust includes <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2024/05/23/vanderbilt-board-of-trust-elects-three-new-members/">energy executives from Chevron, former Republican senators, and hedge fund managers</a>.</p><p><strong>Vanderbilt Medical Center</strong> took the hypocrisy further. They <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2025/07/08/lgbtq-community-leaders-decry-layoffs-at-vumc-office-supporting-access-to-lgbtq-care/">laid off their entire LGBTQ Health Program staff on June 24, 2025</a> — during Pride Month's final week. Five staff members gone. A 12-hour trans support hotline, terminated. A decade of patient navigation services, eliminated. This from an institution that <a href="https://news.vumc.org/2022/03/28/vumc-again-named-a-leader-in-lgbtq-healthcare-equality/">won seven Human Rights Campaign awards</a> for LGBTQ+ healthcare equality.</p><p><strong>HCA Healthcare</strong>, Nashville's healthcare giant, reveals similar patterns. Despite receiving <a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospital-systems/hca-return-6b-cares-act-funds-accelerated-payments">$1.6 billion in CARES Act pandemic relief grants</a>, HCA <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/06/coronavirus-hca-healthcare-nurse-union-busting/">pulled nurses off shifts during COVID surges to attend mandatory anti-union meetings</a>. The company <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/workers-us-hospital-giant-hca-say-puts-profits-patient-care-rcna64122">staffs hospitals 30% below national averages</a> while <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-hca-workers-rally-against-politicaldonations-20220421-qhvmwfcma5fp3jnxjswuoythbi-story.html">donating over $7 million to Florida PACs supporting Ron DeSantis</a> — an opponent of the very Medicaid expansion that would reduce their uncompensated care burden.</p><p>The pattern extends across Nashville's healthcare systems. <strong>Ascension Saint Thomas Health</strong> follows <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/10/10/abortion-catholic-hospitals-birth-control/">Catholic directives that prohibit contraception, sterilization, and emergency contraception</a>. Women have been denied tubal ligations during C-sections, requiring separate surgeries elsewhere. Yet the system promotes itself as serving all community members with compassion.</p><p><strong>Neighborhood Health</strong>, despite LGBTQ-welcoming language, no longer offers gender-affirming care services, hormone therapy, or specialized LGBTQ+ healthcare — services still available at other Nashville providers. The brand says welcome. The build says you're on your own.</p><p>Ask each of the leaders behind these choices, and they claim to have good reasons. And some of them do. Some have made the hard choice to sacrifice the care of the few to continue to support others. But with this loss of service comes a shift in the systemic identity of these organizations. What was once a refuge is now part of the system of oppression in some contexts.</p><p>The solution is not to pretend this is fine, that this is just the cost of doing business in Trump’s America. If leaders cannot find the time or humility to find ways to contribute to the parallel world of care and mutual aid we will need, the least they could do is to not feed into the delusion that they are still our saviors in crisis.</p><p>If Trumpism has one unmistakable side effect, it is the ability to cause centrist Liberals to melt down and they try to reconcile their budgets, the political ambivalence of their boards, and their egos. Many people are learning the hard way that the philanthropic fix to societal injustice is no fix at all, and are watching their reputations crumble as capital does what capital does.</p><p>To them I say: let the ego die, and welcome to the revolution.</p><h3><strong>The Machinery of Compliance</strong></h3><p>After <a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/05/04/ice-immigration-operation-nashville/">ICE and Tennessee Highway Patrol swept through Latino neighborhoods in May</a> — approximately 500 traffic stops, 196 arrests — Nashville created the <a href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/mayor/news/belonging-fund-launches-provide-emergency-support-immigrants-nashville">"Belonging Fund."</a> It treated state sanctioned family separation (a human rights violation) as an acute disaster. Not a creeping epidemic, but a one time natural disaster. For those affected during a short window, it covered rent, food, transportation, childcare. Everything except legal defense. That exclusion tells you everything: the city will help you cope with enforcement but won't challenge it.</p><p>This isn't just weakness; it's strategy. Tennessee law makes sanctuary policies a felony — up to 6 years in prison for officials who vote for them. Metro's Legal Director admitted the city is "powerless" against ICE. But powerlessness becomes convenient cover. The city gets to maintain its "welcoming" brand while its lawyers shrug: "Our hands are tied."</p><p>The surveillance story writes itself. <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/freddie-oconnell-on-fusus/article_320f6fc2-f942-11ef-9753-dba358b5cb56.html">Mayor O'Connell campaigned opposing police surveillance, then backed the Fusus network as mayor</a> — it <a href="https://wpln.org/post/after-a-year-of-uncertainty-nashvilles-council-rejects-fusus-police-surveillance-tool/">failed by one vote</a>. Not because the administration fought against it, but because privacy advocates asked questions the firm's lobbyists couldn't answer. Questions the administration and Council weren't particularly interested in asking.</p><p><a href="https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/03/27/solaren-risk-management-security-guard-licensing/">Solaren Risk Management</a>, contracted by the Nashville Downtown Partnership to provide security on Lower Broadway, is currently facing serious scrutiny. The Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance filed a hearing notice in July 2024, charging the company with 62 violations — ranging from improperly licensed staff to the use of "police" insignia by security guards who lack state-certified law enforcement authority. Previous testimony also highlighted instances of fake or fabricated training documents and identification used to assert exemptions under state law.</p><p>This is the security apparatus they're building while claiming to reimagine public safety. Funded through mandatory "special assessments" that Council deliberately doesn't review, operated by a shadow government everyone pretends not to see, enforced by companies literally faking their credentials. Progressive branding, authoritarian build, democratic negligence.</p><h3><strong>The Victimhood Industrial Complex</strong></h3><p>Watch how quickly power becomes powerlessness when accountability arrives.</p><p>Metro's Legal Director admits the city is "powerless" against ICE. O'Connell claims state law prevents sanctuary policies while choosing not to test those limits or mobilize resistance.</p><p>Vanderbilt administrators cry poverty about worker wages while sitting on $10.3 billion. "Market rates," they explain, as if they don't set the market. As if paying living wages wouldn't create a more stable workforce, reduce turnover costs, and build the kind of thriving community that makes their university more valuable. When criticized for firing LGBTQ staff, VUMC blamed "budget constraints" — not their choice to cut these positions first.</p><p>HCA executives claim nurse staffing shortages are a "national crisis" while staffing 30% below average and spending billions on stock buybacks. They're not causing the crisis — they're victims of it, apparently. Never mind that adequate staffing reduces medical errors, lawsuits, and turnover — creating long-term value they're too focused on quarterly earnings to see.</p><p>This manufactured helplessness serves three functions:</p><ol><li><p>It deflects moral responsibility ("Don't blame us, blame the system")</p></li><li><p>It discourages resistance ("If we can't change it, how could you?")</p></li><li><p>It maintains “progressive” credibility ("We hate this as much as you do")</p></li></ol><p>But sometimes it's not even helplessness — it's choreographed negligence. Take the Downtown Partnership: they submit budgets as legally required, Council receives them, Metro Finance processes them, then everyone collectively ignores the actual approval requirement. Twenty years of this dance. Everyone can claim they did their part while ensuring no oversight actually happens. This is worse than corruption — corruption at least admits something wrong is happening. This is complicity wrapped in compliance, where everyone's technically following procedures while deliberately abandoning their actual responsibilities.</p><p>The most insidious part: they position themselves as suffering <em>more</em> than the people they harm. The mayor is "heartbroken" about sweeps. University presidents are "deeply troubled" by low wages. Healthcare CEOs "agonize" over staffing cuts. Their pain becomes the story. The actual victims — swept homeless people, poverty-wage workers, patients without care — become supporting characters in the leader's heroic struggle against insurmountable forces.</p><p><em>"The test is simple: Does it decentralize power? Does it advance equity? Does it give communities real control? If the answer is no, it's not progressivism — it's PR."</em></p><h3><strong>Breaking the Pattern Before It Hardens</strong></h3><p>What’s happening in Nashville isn’t just a clash of political styles. It’s the local front of a much bigger fight — between systems that adapt, share power, and learn, and systems that enforce power with the bluntest tools possible.</p><p>Authoritarianism is the simplest of these systems. Its rules are easy to write because no one cares whether they make sense in practice. They’re applied selectively, bent or ignored for the powerful, and enforced with precision against the powerless. Complexity, nuance, and fairness aren’t bugs to be fixed — they’re threats to be eliminated.</p><p>Progressive centrism, as it’s practiced here, doesn’t challenge that logic. It dresses the city in progressive language, then runs the same hierarchy underneath. It drains energy from actual reform, teaches people that promises and results don’t have to match, and normalizes the idea that power can say one thing while doing another. That gap doesn’t just breed cynicism — it clears a path for the authoritarian pattern to move in, because it’s the only one still moving.</p><p>This isn’t about whether you prefer the left or the right. It’s about which pattern wins: the one that self-corrects and broadens participation, or the one that punishes, concentrates power, and stops adapting altogether.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>How to Tilt the Field Toward Openness</strong></h3><p>Step one is transparency — not as a campaign plank, but as the absolute legal minimum. Budgets submitted and actually reviewed. Oversight bodies meeting in public with real records. Contract terms disclosed before they’re signed. Data released in real time, in formats the public can use without an accounting degree. This isn’t a luxury — it’s the ground you have to stand on to fight for anything else.</p><p>Step two is using the system’s own drivers to push results it would rather avoid:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Exploit brand sensitivity:</strong> If the city will contort itself to protect its “progressive” image, make the cost of harming people higher — in bad press, boycotts, and political damage — than the cost of fixing the harm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hijack compliance rituals:</strong> Every time the system is forced to pass a budget, renew a contract, or issue a report, use that moment to surface what it’s hiding and demand a response.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create reforms that grow by themselves:</strong> Design programs so that once in place, they expand automatically — more coverage, more funding, more reach — unless someone stops them in public.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make the contradictions impossible to ignore:</strong> Pair every “equity” slogan with the material harm it covers for, until the brand stops working as camouflage.<br><br></p></li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Three Roles in the Same Fight</strong></h3><p><strong>Leaders who actually want to lead:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Stop hiding behind the brand.</strong> Tie every public pledge to hard numbers, clear deadlines, and public reporting. No vague “progress updates.” If the results aren’t there, own it — or fix it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lock the doors behind you.</strong> Once you pass a reform, design it so it automatically renews or expands unless overturned in public session. Make it legally and politically expensive to roll back.</p></li><li><p><strong>Put the watchdogs out of reach.</strong> Create oversight bodies that can’t be defunded, stacked, or quietly dissolved. Staff them with people who aren’t beholden to you — and give them teeth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it personal.</strong> When the system drifts toward authoritarianism, don’t just “disagree” in press statements — drag it into the sunlight, name names, and force a public choice.</p></li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><strong>Insiders resisting from within:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Keep your own receipts — always.</strong> Make personal, secure copies of budgets, contracts, enforcement actions, and internal memos. Store them where no one in leadership can scrub them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weaponize the paperwork.</strong> Use every official process — audits, public records requests, meeting minutes, compliance reports — to put uncomfortable facts where erasing them would be a crime.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build cross-office escape hatches for information.</strong> Share what you know with trusted allies in other departments before it can be “sanitized.” Make suppression slower, riskier, and more expensive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slip truth into the machinery.</strong> Put real numbers into official reports. Add agenda items that force uncomfortable topics into public view. Use “routine” briefings to make secrecy harder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Defend your own.</strong> If a colleague risks themselves to surface the truth, protect them with process, publicity, and solidarity. Make retaliation a liability, not a reflex.</p></li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><strong>Outsiders applying pressure:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Expose the hypocrisy with teeth.</strong> Pair their slogans with their actions side-by-side — the Pride flag next to the staff layoffs, the “public safety” campaign next to police harassment data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attack where they care most.</strong> If they bend over backwards for tourism or corporate investment, make injustice more expensive than fixing it — in bad press, boycotts, and lawsuits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build what they won’t.</strong> Tenant unions, mutual aid networks, community safety patrols — real solutions that work without permission, and that they can’t quietly dismantle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep the fight material, not symbolic.</strong> Demand budget shifts, policy changes, and oversight powers. Don’t let them retreat into “values” language when the stakes are concrete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Amplify the leaks.</strong> When insiders risk exposure, make sure their information travels — fast, loud, and beyond the reach of city hall damage control.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3><strong>The Stakes</strong></h3><p>Authoritarianism doesn’t have to be smart to win. Its simplicity is its strength: rules applied whether or not they fit, ignored for those who can dodge them, enforced relentlessly on everyone else. Progressive centrism, when it shields rather than dismantles old hierarchies, ends up paving the road for that simplicity to take over.</p><p>The counter-pattern is harder. It requires rules that apply to everyone, transparency that makes hypocrisy costly, and reforms that grow stronger with time instead of weaker. It’s messier, slower, and less flattering in the short term. But it’s the only way to keep the dumb, brutal efficiency of authoritarian control from becoming the only game left.</p><p>The center will move. The question is whether it moves toward systems that adapt and share power — or toward systems where the rules are simple because no one in charge cares if they make sense, and they never apply to the people writing them.</p>
