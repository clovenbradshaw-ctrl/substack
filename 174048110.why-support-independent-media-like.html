Here’s his opening summary:<br></p><blockquote><h4>Mike Lacy's Rich Text Substack: A force in Nashville accountability journalism</h4><p>Mike Lacy's {Rich Text} Substack has emerged as one of Nashville's most influential independent media voices, combining rigorous investigative journalism with philosophical depth to examine power structures, government accountability, and social justice in Tennessee's capital. With over 1,600 subscribers and documented impact on local policy discussions, Lacy has transformed from a "recovering government employee" into a critical watchdog of Nashville municipal affairs, producing work that has sparked government responses, influenced media coverage, and created lasting historical documentation of the city's political controversies.</p><p>The publication, launched at prometheoid.substack.com, describes itself with characteristic wit as covering "Nashville politics, metamodern philosophy, nonboring data science musings, and an unhealthy interest in Tom Cruise." This tagline captures Lacy's distinctive approach: serious investigative work delivered with philosophical sophistication and cultural references that make complex policy issues accessible. His background managing over $5 million in budgets within Metro government provides insider knowledge that enriches his analysis of municipal operations. </p></blockquote><p>Aw, shucks. Thanks, Claude!<br></p><div><hr></div><h3>Why Doing the “Right Thing” Gets You In Trouble</h3><h5>Spoiler: it’s because we have different frameworks on how we view morality</h5><p></p><p>Let me take up some of your time talking about what the cost for me has been to do this kind of work. I mostly push that aside and don’t think about that, but I think that’s not healthy for me.</p><p>I’ve joked in the past about this work making it hard for me to get a job locally, especially in any space where I have experience and insights related to what I write about. In ways that I don’t feel its appropriate or necessary to go into, I do want to clarify, that’s not a joke. </p><p>We all </p><p>And in the past few years I have come across many people who have it worse than me, who have been retaliated against, explicitly or implicitly, <em>for doing the right thing</em>. </p><p>And to say a little more about <em>doing the right thing</em>, which is a bit too much of a black and white phrase for my taste, what I’ve seen is that people are push out not because they’re following the moral imperatives. But because they are operating off of, what our systems of power deem, <em>the wrong kind of morals.</em></p><p>Morality, many much smarter people than me going back to the ancient sages of the far east and before, is not a monolith. The most popular frame to talk about this in the west is Kholberg’s Stages of Moral Development.</p><p>When you are willing to, for example, disobey an unethical order, or correct a superior where they are mistaken of something gravely important — that is operating at stage 5 or 6 in Kholberg’s famous Stages of Moral Development.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a

I did it not because of anything anyone said to me or asked me to do, but because no one said anything to me or asked me to do — quite literally. From September 22 to mid November, the Office I worked in, the Office of Community Safety, we didn’t get a single email asking us what we were doing. There wasn’t a single meeting checking if we were mission aligned, asking about the grants we had outgoing. There wasn’t a work session set up with the new administration regarding the <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/2023/10/02/mayor-oconnell-secures-nearly-2m-grant-fund-violence-prevention-program/">$2M Community Safety Grant</a> I applied for and won from the DOJ, an accomplishment I made sure Mayor O’Connell took credit for even though it was submitted before he won.</p><p>The most direct communication I had was asking me and my co-workers with offices downstairs to no longer use the upstairs coffee maker, the one adjacent to the senior staff offices. They would give us coffee for the downstairs machine. And would we mind also moving deeper into the basement? </p><p>It was all… quite weird stuff to happen from a Mayor that had won on a platform of “15 Fixes on Day One” that included releasing a Community Safety plan on that first day.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

They weren’t stopping the work from happening, but they also weren’t doing anything to institutionalize it, help make it sustainable and live beyond us.</p><p>We were beyond hopeful that Mayor O’Connell would help make this vision happen. I remember standing at Brooklyn Bowl the night of his inauguration party, standing next to my partner, the deep anxiety I’d build up in my body these past few years defending support for the vulnerable in a system that seemed indifferent to them, start to release.

Those with more experience with local politics than watching the nightly news or glossing centrist liberal Tiktoks know that the powers in place are not operating with any new, “truly progressive”, Kholberg level 5 or 6 morality.
