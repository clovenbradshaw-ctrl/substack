She had never set foot in Tennessee before landing at the Nashville Rescue Mission with her young daughter, leaving behind everything they knew in California for the promise of something better.</p><p>“I’ve never been in Nashville. Never been in here until, this is my first time,” she recalls, the memory still fresh despite the months that have passed. The move wasn’t planned—it was necessity. A single mother dealing with severe fibroids that doctors had misdiagnosed since 2018, first as acid reflux, she had been told she couldn’t have children after the fibroids multiplied and enlarged. Her daughter’s very existence defied those medical predictions, and protecting that miracle became her driving force.</p><p>She’d gotten to Nashville with a bus ticket paid by a group out of West Memphis. Nashville was chosen simply because there was room. So limited are the options in our country that she travelled across nearly its whole length to move into a homeless shelter.</p><p>At the shelter, without a job and new to the city, she focused on maintaining something she refused to compromise on: her daughter’s education. She’s kept her daughter enrolled in virtual K-12 homeschooling, a decision rooted in both faith and practicality.</p><p>“She’s progressed more than in public school,” she explains. “She was in public school for like a year, she didn’t like it. A lot of distractions.” When she prayed about it, she felt God telling her to keep her daughter in virtual school—a decision she feels was prophetic as school shootings continued making headlines.</p><p>At the shelter, Holly, a case manager, approached her with news that seemed like divine providence: without applying, without even knowing such a program existed, she and her daughter had been selected for special housing assistance through Metro’s Office of Homeless Services. A full year of rent, paid by the city. A housing voucher at the end. A real apartment instead of a shelter bed.</p><p>“They showed up picking you without you applying being like, ‘we’re going to pay your rent for a year,’” is how she describes it now, still incredulous at how it all began.</p><p>The Office of Homeless Services moved quickly. They toured her through facilities, had her sign a lease that OHS then took possession of. No copy for her. No mention of Metro or OHS anywhere on the paperwork—just her name on a document she never could have qualified for on her own. She had no idea she was about to become a test case in Nashville’s shadow housing experiment, or that speaking truth about what happened to her and other families would require the kind of courage that reshapes identities.</p><p>The name on the lease that OHS told her to sign is Kirsney. But she says she’s starting to prefer to go by Esther, from the Bible—the queen who risked everything to expose a plot against her people, who revealed hidden truths to power when staying silent would have been safer.</p><p>Esther’s story, and that of others, will continue to be told as this investigation unfolds.</p><h3><strong>What We Know</strong></h3><p>As per the Nashville Scene: Nashville’s Office of Homeless Services quietly diverted federal funds to create an off-the-books housing program that left vulnerable families facing eviction after the city broke its promises. Under Director April Calvin’s “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing” initiative—a term that exists nowhere in federal housing policy—at least eight families including Misty Hill’s and Kirsney Cunningham’s were lured with guarantees of year-long rent payments and future Section 8 vouchers, only to face months of missed payments, unsafe conditions, and abandonment when the money ran out. The shadow program, operating since at least August 2024, represents the latest chapter in what investigative journalist Eli Motycka revealed in the Scene.</p><p>Motycka’s work is based heavily in my investigations and I was credited as a contributor to the story.</p><p>Metro’s scheme, whatever its function, was funded with roughly $100k‑$150k COVID‑relief money not set aside for this purpose, bypassed the city’s coordinated‑entry system, and sent funding (as much as $7,000 at a time) to private companies that had no contract with Metro.</p><p>OHS efforts, however <em>non-traditional</em>, were rewarded in the FY26 Metro Budget with $2.6M for “non-traditional rapid rehousing,” a term that has absolutely no grounding in any academic context, or otherwise for that matter. Literally the only thing that shows up when you Google this phrase is things that Director Calvin has said, and the FY26 Nashville Metro Budget.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png" width="782" height="1284" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1284,&quot;width&quot;:782,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zis8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c42656-6cdd-4125-ae16-44b8239740b6_782x1284.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3><strong>But what actually is Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing?</strong></h3><p>Eli and I found out. Or we’re starting to at least. We talked to two families that went through this process. It was a horrific experience. But at first it seemed like a gift from god, a blessing that had fallen into their lap.</p><p>According to two of the families involved, they were told by a case manager at the Rescue Mission that they had been selected, without them having applied or even being aware this opportunity existed, for a program through Metro’s Office of Homeless Services. They would be given a full year of rent to live at an apartment complex instead of the homeless shelter, and by the end of that year, they would have a housing voucher they could use as a subsidy to pay rent anywhere that was willing and certified to take this form of payment.</p><p>This housing transition from the shelter to these facilities was confirmed by OHS officials, allegedly at the request of The Nashville Rescue Mission.</p><p>Something startling has been obtained. Photographic evidence exists of the selection process of these families, which appears to at least partly have taken place informally over text messages. Director Calvin herself is visible in these text messages deciding which families will be housed, and appears to be providing (via insecure group text messages) the PDF files of the families’ confidential Homelessness Management Information System (HMIS) documents. Visible in these messages (even in screenshot form) is confidential information such as their HMIS numbers.</p><p>According to two of the affected families, they were funneled through a prompt tour of facilities and led to sign leases between themselves and the apartment complex, leases they never would have been able to obtain on their own merit.</p><p><strong>OHS and Metro Nashville does not appear anywhere on these leases, despite the explicitly stated arrangement for them to be paying rent for a year. After the tenants signed these leases, OHS allegedly took these leases and did not provide the tenants a copy.</strong></p><h3><strong>A Golden Ticket or a Monkey’s Paw?</strong></h3><p>Having seemingly won a housing lottery they did not know they had entered, things began to go very wrong. In April 2025, the residents placed in housing by OHS were told that they would need to start paying a portion of their own rent in an as yet undisclosed stair step model where they would have to provide 100% rent within four months.</p><p>The two families spoken to claim that this was not disclosed with them whatsoever when OHS first approached them through their case manager at The Nashville Rescue Mission, nor was it ever stated during the lease signing process. These assertions align with what their case manager with Step Up claims took place.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png" width="820" height="1130" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1130,&quot;width&quot;:820,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!45iV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb11301ac-1abb-4930-b9cd-846564219d06_820x1130.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>With the tenants unable to pay rents in the facilities the OHS placed them in, intent to evict notices began appearing on tenants rooms.

In fact, was told on many occasions this was not something that they could provide.</p><p>I also knew that guaranteeing a housing voucher is not something a person acting in good faith can do. They are few and far between and the wait is long — but they are something that, if offered by someone with authority, could get someone to agree to a circumstance they might not otherwise agree to.</p><p>When I first reached out to OHS back in April, unintentionally framing my question as if they provided rapid rehousing services, Demetris Chaney was crystal clear: “the Office of Homeless Services functions as a referral source for the agencies with RRH funding.” This was in April, 2025 — unbeknownst to me the same time (coincidentally, <em>the very next day</em>) after they told tenants whose rent they had been paying they were being cut off.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

And if multiple sources with first person knowledge of it hadn’t independently confirmed it, I would still be skeptical.</p><p>What else was strange is that this was alleged to have happened entirely outside of the normal Coordinated Entry (CE) process. Coordinated Entry is the Federal HUD mandated process by which all resources that federal funds, including those provided by non-government agencies, must be transparent with their resources and prioritization. The problem that this is meant to solve is to make sure that those with the greatest need receive help, rather letting people cut the line who are who are politically convenient (or who are living somewhere politically inconvenient).</p><p>It wasn’t until I saw text messages of Director Calvin hand picking (and rejecting) families to place in this housing that I was convinced that this had happened:</p><p>Without applying to any sort of program, people had been told they were selected to receive housing paid for by the Office of Homeless Services, that they would receive a housing voucher, and that they needed to act immediately to obtain this. They were taken to an apartment complex. The two families I was able to speak to both referenced housing that was converted hotel or motel.</p><p>They were told to sign a one-year lease and that OHS would take care of the rest. Allegedly the leases, once signed, were taken by OHS, and not provided directly to the residents. The leases I was able to obtain showed these families who, by their own accord, would not have been able to qualify for any lease of this kind without OHS, or another provider or co-signer, yet they did so here without OHS being mentioned anywhere in the contract.</p><h3><strong>The Nightmarish Living Conditions</strong></h3><p>The stories of living in these adapted hotel room units are nightmarish, to put it lightly.</p><p>These are allegations that are not as yet independently verified, but were conveyed by the residents OHS placed in these facilites.</p><p>Here’s what we were told: Employees would enter people’s rooms without permission. People broke into unoccupied rooms and began illegally subletting them out to other unhoused people. The shared kitchen they all had to use was inaccessible for months when a man made it is improvised home after having a fight with his partner. The young daughter of a friend was allegedly attacked and nearly raped by another resident. One of the women I spoke to asserts she herself was sexually harassed by employees of the facility. She also claims that her mail was being opened by this man who somehow knew intimate details of her medical history, information contained in correspondence she was getting from her doctor. And when she notified the operator of the facility, they told her it must have been the mailman opening the mail and left it at that.</p><p>Another woman detailed how the unit she, her husband, and their child with special needs were living in had its ceiling collapse one day. Her husband and son were out of the house, and she was only <em>mildly</em> injured. All of their property was destroyed. They were not compensated for any of it.</p><p>These are just a headline problems that this unrequested golden ticket had brought on them. But if one is honest, these horrific experiences too far outside the norms of living in the extremes of American poverty. What is highly unusual is how they got into these situations.</p><h3><strong>The Broken Promises</strong></h3><p>By August, the rent stopped showing up for most tenants. Employees of the facilities housing people desperately reached out for payment.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

In meetings earlier in the year when the revelation they not going to be paying a full years rent was revealed, it was suggested that tenants should have been saving their money. According to a case manager, a woman was told that she needed to stop homeschooling her daughter so that she could work during the day.</p><p>No explanation was ever given as to why their circumstances had changed. The closest thing to an explanation was that the person who had made these promises was no longer employed at OHS. If it was a rogue employee who set up this non-traditional rapid rehousing program, it is odd that their experiment was rewarded in the FY26 budget with $2.4M to expand this program.</p><h3><strong>The Chain of Command</strong></h3><p>One resident reports that she had a meeting with the second-ranking official at OHS, Marvin Trotter, and when she detailed the stair-step model of rent payment that had been sprung on her and other residents, he expressed surprise, and that he had never been aware of such an arrangement.</p><p>One of the tenants was able to follow the chain of command of OHS up to the only Metro official with direct oversight of it: Nashville’s mayor, Freddie O’Connell. She alleges that she spoke directly with Mayor O’Connell about her situation. I can’t confirm whether it was indeed the mayor himself who she spoke to. But I was provided screenshots of a phone call between her and the phone number of the mayor’s office in which various conversations in excess of 15 minutes in length took place.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png" width="257" height="571.9054242002782" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:719,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:257,&quot;bytes&quot;:131755,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ysfG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61455fd8-2d9a-4575-a127-2e7c2a607af7_719x1600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>She reports that the conversation with the mayor focused on troubleshooting the housing voucher situation and not addressing the overall bizarreness of her situation.

The delay was so severe that the landlord, concerned for her and her daughter’s wellbeing, allowed them to move in a month early.

Nor can you use money set aside from one thing and spend it another thing, even if you are entitled to do that second thing.

The funds in there were later amended to also be able to be used for contracts with the organizations Community Care Foundation and LaunchPad. The rent payments that I’ve found did not flow through these organizations that had been authorized recipients of these funds. The organizations that did receive it—for-profit landlords of these facilities—have no Metro contract, even though they were receiving checks over five thousand dollars, the maximum that can be given to an organization outside of procurement processes.</p><p>What I also discovered is that in addition to these two locations, Metro was paying another organization in a similar period from the same pool of money called “ESA Management”, which I researched and found out stands for Extended Stay America. These are rental properties that people lease out for a few days to months to longer term. In asking people around the homelessness community if it was possible OHS was placing people there, they said that it would not be unexpected if one of their contracted nonprofits they work with were placing people there. But what I found was not money flowing to Extended Stay America through any of these contracts, but it was being paid from the same pool of money originally set aside for Strobel House.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png" width="1456" height="1198" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1198,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6DQS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d48f192-806b-4187-a195-7d8808f6145d_1600x1317.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I did some gumshoeing and confirmed that yes, OHS had housed people there. And some people are still there. Who is there? That’s not actually anything I should know. It is none of my business—or anyone else’s who lacks professional certification to use the HMIS system—to know this. But since this is happening outside the established Coordinated Entry, outside of any normal channels of providing support, this is completely opaque to the broader homelessness system. These people have been, for all intents and purposes, <em>disappeared.</em> But, you can bet, they are listed as “no longer homeless.”</p><h3><strong>“Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing”</strong></h3><p>Trying to figure out what in the world was going on here, I turned to Director Calvin’s public comments. She talked at various points in the lead up to the FY26 budget of something she was calling <strong>“non-traditional rapid rehousing,”</strong> and in the FY26 budget proposal submitted by the mayor, there was $2.4 million dollars for this thing.</p><p>There’s absolutely no public record in conventional housing journals in the academic literature about anything called non-traditional rapid rehousing. This seems to have been an invention of Director Calvin.</p><p>Around the time I was flagging these issues with the mayor’s office and her office, she submitted to the Homelessness Planning Council, the night before a meeting was to take place, a proposed alteration to the Coordinated Entry manual. Coordinated Entry is the standardized housing system by which all people are prioritized, and collaboration takes place across all providers that receive federal HUD funding.</p><p>The proposal, which had not gone through the committee that actually oversees any edits (the committee whose members seemed astounded that they were being bypassed for this last-minute proposal from the director), posited that the Coordinated Entry supervisor of the Continuum of Care system, which is currently designated as the Office of Homeless Services, should be entitled to use funds to place people however they see fit outside of the Coordinated Entry model.</p><p>This would in effect allow OHS to, if they had legitimate money for the purpose, place people into housing with no oversight or coordination with the rest of the city—essentially legitimizing a completely shadow version of a homelessness system without transparency or accountability, reporting exclusively to the mayor.</p><h3><strong>The Cover-Up Continues</strong></h3><p>Eight families have been identified. Two have spoken to the media. But billing patterns, like that of Extended Stay America receiving payments, month after month, and the scale of diverted funds suggest there are more—families who may be receiving eviction notices right now, today, as this investigation continues. Families who were promised a year of stability and instead got abandonment when the money ran out.</p><p>But here’s what should terrify every Nashville resident: people are being placed outside Coordinated Entry, vanishing from the official tracking systems that are supposed to monitor their wellbeing. When OHS diverts families into shadow housing, they disappear from HMIS visibility, from any oversight that other service providers can access. If not for a data filtering error that exposed payments to Extended Stay America—payments that were never supposed to be visible—we would never have known OHS was placing vulnerable families there, outside of any approved program, outside of federal oversight.</p><p>Think about that: Extended Stay America received roughly $100,000 in Metro funds to house people no one else in the homelessness system knew were there. These families exist in a parallel universe—counted as “housed” in the city’s success statistics while living in properties with no contracts, no oversight, no accountability. Calvin instructed that this “dynamic process... should not be posted publicly.” Now we know why.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png" width="1334" height="672" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:672,&quot;width&quot;:1334,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2RB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0543cef9-e7cc-48c4-9437-cfcc218f0751_1334x672.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This isn’t just accounting fraud. This is a deliberate system for circumventing federal oversight. Who authorized placing families outside Coordinated Entry? Who else knows that vulnerable citizens are being hidden in hotels and extended stays, invisible to the very systems designed to protect them?</p><p>The missing invoices aren’t an oversight. Every Extended Stay payment, every bulk rent transfer—systematically excluded from Council Member Welsch’s ARPA records request. Someone made a deliberate decision about what Metro Council would and wouldn’t see. The accidentally unfiltered DePaul export revealed the Extended Stay America payments that no one was meant to find. Without that mistake, those families would have remained ghosts. What other shadow placements are still hidden?</p><p>Mayor O’Connell’s office called tenants directly—we have the screenshots. Mayors don’t make routine housing placement calls. They make damage control calls. When exactly did O’Connell learn his Office of Homeless Services was placing people outside federal tracking systems? Why did his response involve personal phone calls instead of immediately halting the program?</p><p>Calvin’s desperate attempt to rewrite Coordinated Entry rules the night before a council meeting reveals consciousness of guilt. Bypassing the oversight committee, she tried to retroactively legitimize what had already been done—create a provision allowing OHS to place people outside federal oversight whenever they deemed fit. This wasn’t policy-making. It was an attempt to legalize a shadow system already operating, to normalize the practice of hiding Nashville’s most vulnerable citizens from the systems meant to track their care.</p><p>The federal implications are staggering. Nashville used ARPA funds specifically designated for Strobel House to pay Extended Stay America, The Avenue, and Hillside Crossing. Every person placed outside Coordinated Entry represents potential federal fraud. Every family hidden from HMIS is a violation of HUD requirements. Has Treasury been notified? How many millions in COVID relief funds were diverted to this shadow system?</p><p>And here’s the truly damning part: instead of stopping this experiment after families received eviction notices, after mothers like Esther and Misty begged for help, after the Extended Stay America payments were exposed, the administration doubled down. They allocated $2.4 million in FY26 to expand “Non-Traditional Rapid Rehousing”—institutionalizing a system for hiding people that exists nowhere in federal policy, nowhere in academic literature, nowhere except in April Calvin’s imagination and Mayor O’Connell’s budget.</p><p>Until these questions are answered, Nashville families remain at risk of being placed into a shadow housing system that operates outside federal guidelines, without oversight, without accountability, and with devastating consequences for those who were promised help only to disappear from every system meant to ensure their safety.</p><p>They’re placing people outside the system. In darkness. And if not for a data filtering error that exposed Extended Stay America, we might never have known this shadow system existed at all.</p><p>More as this situation unfolds.</p>
