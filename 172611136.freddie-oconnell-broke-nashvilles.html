Criticism of this office has been waved away by the highest spheres of political power in Nashville, as late as this weekend, as a clash of personalities — ad hominem attacks on a department director whose only crime is being unpopular.</p><p>However, this request for an internal audit, submitted to the Office of the Metro Internal Audit, is not based on the popularity of any particular department leader. Grounded in evidence from hard fought public records requests obtained by people like me, and buttressed by astounding testimony rendered across multiple Metro Council meetings last month, it cites specific transactions totaling in the millions of dollars that appear problematic. It points to nearly a year of a facility serving our most vulnerable, operated with no contract, all while documented cases of violence, injury, and property damage took place outside of any public view or oversight.</p><p>All this in the context that Metro's homelessness system is, by any reasonable metric, broken. Despite a two fold increase in funding since 2021, an exploding workforce of full-time city funded homeless serving staffers, Nashville is recording no increase in placing people in permanent housing. In fact, the only metric that has moved alongside funding is the number of people displaced from encampments and put somewhere else in the city — rarely with any form of permanent housing.</p><p>A person might ask, maybe someone who cares for the well being of our vulnerable neighbors, or maybe someone who cares about having any real ROI on our public investments: What the hell is going on here?</p><p>Well, to understand where we are, we need to talk about how we got there. There are several narratives to explain this situation.</p><p>One is a conspiracy theory, absurd and nonsensical, but useful for those interested in framing this as a problem caused by the very people sounding the alarm about this crisis. It is a theory popular with the conservative wing of the Metro Council, spread I'm told by OHS officials themselves, claiming that it is in fact the advocates for the unhoused who are somehow tanking the city's efforts to end homelessness – doing so out of their own pecuniary self-interest.</p><p>If homelessness were solved, they'd be out of a job! And "solving homelessness", we assume, would be just around the corner if not for them short circuiting it by advocating for… housing for the unhoused. Don't think too hard about it, it's more vibes than logic. This 4th grader's idea for systems analysis is a cousin to anti-regulation rhetoric aimed at curbing dissent promulgated by the Koch and Exxon-funded American Enterprise Institute with its "Good Neighbor Index": If anyone is speaking out about the system, this perspective goes, they're the problem. But its purpose, like most conspiracy theories, isn't actually to explain things — it's to make you stop looking for the real answers.</p><p>The other narrative is simpler and based on what actually happened: Nashville's homeless services system got redesigned to put all the power in one place—Metro government—and then that centralized system stopped working. Whether this was the plan all along or just the predictable result of not trusting communities to handle their own problems, the outcome is the same: Metro controls everything now, and nothing is getting better.</p><p>Metro Nashville now holds all the power. Every city that gets federal homelessness funding has a "Continuum of Care" (CoC)—a network that coordinates services and resources. Normally, these CoCs are run by independent nonprofits, not city government. That separation is intentional: it keeps real estate developers and corporate interests from using city hall to bulldoze homeless people out of profitable areas.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png" width="1456" height="1229" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1229,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W95u!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758d49e8-0f76-49b9-9328-44d87cd5c37c_1600x1350.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Adapted<a href="https://information.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2020-112/introduction.html"> from</a></strong></em></p><p>Metro Nashville is very unusual in that all of the power positions of the CoC now reside in the local government. And the outcomes, or lack thereof, is the precise reason why this is a bad idea.</p><p>Whether by design or accident, Metro government gained the power to solve Nashville's real problem—and it's not homelessness. The real problem, based on what the system actually does, is how to clear out homeless people without all the pesky pushback about human rights and sustainable solutions.</p><p>Homelessness is where a city's most powerful and most vulnerable collide. For politicians, having the power to "resolve" this conflict—to clear camps without accountability—is pure gold. For years, you couldn't just bulldoze homeless camps without facing serious blowback. Not from the unhoused themselves, who have little political power, but from their advocates who insist on treating them as human beings rather than obstacles to development.</p><p>And increasingly, these advocates' warnings about power and inequality are reaching people who never thought much about homelessness before. People like me. I didn't start digging into this because homelessness policy is uniquely broken—there's dysfunction everywhere you look. But I realized this is where everything converges: how power gets concentrated, how communities get silenced, how systems get redesigned to serve the powerful instead of solving problems.</p><p>There's a systems theory principle: "A system is what it does." Forget the progressive rhetoric from our civic leaders—look at what their system actually does. The outcomes and documents tell the real story: this isn't a system designed to solve homelessness. It's a system that steamrolls best practices, ignores lived experience, dodges community oversight, and eliminates accountability—all so the city can clear camps wherever developers want to build. That's the real product being delivered here: the power to remove "undesirable" people from valuable real estate without anyone being able to stop you.</p><p>I didn't want to write this. I've been hoping that nudging from the outside, and sending some messages on the backend, might be enough to get some things back on track. I think that was very hubristic and naive of me. What I've come to see is that this is not an information issue. When people have brought these concerns to the highest rungs of power in the city, the response has been "Can you prove to me there is a problem here?"</p><p>I am not sure how I could any more demonstrate that yes, there is a problem here. This isn't just smoke. There are, quite literally, fires.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;f63cae4a-fe1d-4e0e-b78b-e88f472fafa1&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Thursday, August 21, 2025.

Or, at least it's not people misunderstanding me. It's been me misunderstanding what is going on.</p><p>A system is what it does. And this system was very intentionally redesigned to do what it's doing.</p><p>And one of the chief architects of this redesign, the person who wrote the very legislation that created The Office of Homeless Services in 2022, who solely sponsored the no-contest consulting report grant that argued for this vertical integration, and perhaps more to the point, the person who benefitted the most from this consolidating of power and resources, is Mayor Freddie O'Connell.</p><p>No one person could arguably have been more central to the design and execution of a system that has utterly failed to improve, in even the most modest ways, outcomes for the unhoused. Director Calvin has much to be held accountable for. But it should not go ignored that the oversight of her activities, as it was written into the ordinance by then Council Member O'Connell, gives full oversight and hire/fire ability directly to the Mayor. There could have been more oversight written in, there could have been accountability given to the Metro Council, a board, community groups, or the CoC. But that was not the idea.</p><p>And so, there is nothing that OHS has done that is not directly on the hands of the Mayor.</p><p>We need to look at what OHS has been doing the last few years, and we need to look hard.</p><p>But we also need to ask, how did a leader who ran as "Nashville's only truly progressive candidate" perform such an incomprehensible heel turn? Whether intentional or not, he has sold out the well-being of the most vulnerable Nashvillians to gain something.</p><p>I can only hope it was worth it.</p>
