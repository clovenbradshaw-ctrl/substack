<p>Two weeks ago, I helped a woman, “Taylor,” fill out paperwork against her former employer for withholding her paycheck — Latino immigrants are among the most common victims of wage theft. I’ve gotten stiffed working freelance jobs before and it really messed me up. For one it got me into steep credit card debt for years, but more than that it really messed with my trust in others and myself.</p><p>Taylor was owed over $3,000 dollars for cleaning services, and when she was asked to get paid for her work (as one does), she was sent away with threats and insults. Virtually penniless and with children to feed, she sought help from a group I volunteer with to get her fairly compensated. We resolve conflicts between workers and their employers to avoid law suits that are costly and time consuming for everyone.</p><p>I didn’t know that Taylor was a victim of sex trafficking in Mexico by narco-cartel members. I didn’t know she had fled here not for a better life, but to simply <em>be alive.</em> </p><p>I didn’t know at the time Taloy was dealing domestic abuse at home.</p><p>I didn’t know at the time that Taylor was newly pregnant. If I did, I would have told her “Felicidades.”</p><p>She was very sweet and kind. Quiet and patient with me and my broken Spanglish. The last thing I said to her was probably: “Gracias! No problemo.”</p><p>Before January 20, 2025, she would have been a shoo-in for a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-of-human-trafficking-t-nonimmigrant-status">T Visa</a> for victims of human trafficking or a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-of-criminal-activity-u-nonimmigrant-status">U Visa</a> for victims of violent crime, according to the immigration lawyer in my family. Taylor is exactly what our asylum system was designed to help. Like the rest of us, who came here as poor, tired, huddled masses — she’s who this country is made for and made by.</p><p>On Monday, Taylor was deported to Alabama en route to a port of departure — likely under the new administration’s expanded use of <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-mass-deportation-priority">Expedited Removal</a> policies to forcefully eject anyone who comes into ICE’s jurisdiction and has been here less than two years. The most likely outcome is she will be returned to Mexico. Like many immigrants who return under such conditions, she may be murdered by the cartel for speaking against them and escaping their clutches.</p><p>You may have heard part of this story on Tuesday at the Council Meeting on Tuesday when Cathy Carrillo, who until recently was the Director of Community Engagement for the Metro Human Relations Commission. She left her salaried, union job with benefits to be able to speak openly to the city about what’s happening to people she knows.</p><p>I was there that night. But I didn’t realize she was talking about Taylor.</p><p>That messed me up.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gvXqXEc8YVM?si=Da6IM39HQb20KqhP&amp;t=4632" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png" width="1456" height="915" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:915,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2704742,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/gvXqXEc8YVM?si=Da6IM39HQb20KqhP&amp;t=4632&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://prometheoid.substack.com/i/158548126?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X5cf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fad827-3d9f-4a30-8683-9beb0bb9d917_1894x1190.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>On Tuesday, the Metro Council in Nashville was discussing regulations around how a program the Mayor is pushing for will integrate privately owned camera systems with MNPD surveillance tools. The assumption of those supporting those restrictions is that “guardrails” around how MNPD handles data will prevent the extremes of misuse, and it’ll only be used in the event of investigating <em>legitimate crimes </em>or serious emergencies<em>.</em></p><p>It’s about catching mass shooters and chronic vandalizers, the argument goes. Not about scooping up people like Taylor.</p><p>Taylor was taken the previous day from Council Member Ginny Welch’s district. For Welch, her disappearing was a lightning rod during the discussion. But rather than support the restrictions, she resisted them because they were just: “greasing the wheels for Fusus” which many believe could be used by law enforcement to target people for deportation or other identity-based infractions. Why make it easier, her argument went, to justify implementing something that could so easily go wrong?</p><p>Proponents of Fusus, the surveillance technology from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IiVdws0fPizgKiluCUJeUOOU8l5kpKR5mfTbSUvCryE/edit?usp=sharing">controversial Axon corporation</a>, seem to have only begun to realize that surveillance tech in the hands of law enforcement cannot be prevented from causing egregious harm — harm that might outweigh the car break-ins it might stop (a frequent use case Council Members bring up as wanting to solve with Fusus). </p><p>“Well, if there was a Fusus camera there, maybe [Taylor] would be able to use that as evidence to help her deportation case?” A Council Member asked me. It a reasonable question, but doesn’t get at the nuance of things like immigration law, a thing which I realize I may be more familiar with than a lot of people on Council.</p><p>Even before Jan 20, 2025, immigration cases are not about events — things that happened or didn’t happen. The “administrative judges” in immigration court are appointed by the President and the US Attorney General — they are often not lawyers and they exist fully outside the Judicial system. Immigration status cases are not about what someone did, they’re about going through a bureocratic check-list of <em>who someone is</em> and seeing if they fit into any boxes that allow them to stay or require them to leave.</p><p>And those boxes have been changing rapidly, through no fault of people like Taylor.</p><p>When the Department of Homeland Security and its agency the Immigration and Customs Agency (ICE) is given orders deport as many people as humanly possible, through executive orders called things like, I kid you not: “Protecting the American People Against Invasion”, this becomes a logistical problem for them far more than a legal problem.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

passage of Federal and State laws like TNs that require compliance from all level of law enforcement.</p><p>The problem merely becomes finding people within the proximity of crimes whom they can demand, in that single word mantra of the Gestapo: “Papers?”</p><p>But one must <em>find</em> potential crimes by which one has the authority to ask people for their status. Cities like Nashville, with <a href="https://data.nashville.gov/datasets/Nashville::metro-nashville-police-department-active-dispatch/explore">Active Dispatch dashboards</a>, real the tremendous opportunity that is ripe for the picking by agencies like ICE.</p><p>Nashville averages 160 “active dispatches” per day, where police are not only contacted via 911 or otherwise, but sent to a particular location to respond to a particular crime or emergency.</p><p>The most common dispatch <em>by far</em>, is a “commercial burglary alarm.” There are 64 of those a day, accounting for 40% of the total active dispatches. They happen all over the city, but the highest rates are in Hermitage, Antioch, Woodbine, and South. </p><p>But this does not mean that we have an epidemic of commercial burglaries. In fact, 96.17% of these are false alarms — caused, according to <a href="https://www.adt.com/business/resources/security-false-alarm">ADT</a>, primarily by:</p><ol><li><p>Unaware employees [untrained on how to properly arm and disarm systems]</p></li><li><p>Improperly maintained equipment [dead batteries, dust, damage, and out of date]</p></li><li><p>Internal environment problems [e.g. merchandise bumping into motion detectors] </p></li><li><p>Animals(!)

goldmine for an ICE agent that has a quota to make. </p><p>With a tool like Fusus, their job can be as simple as looking at the <a href="https://data.nashville.gov/datasets/Nashville::metro-nashville-police-department-active-dispatch/explore">active dispatch dashboard</a> for one of the 74 (almost certainly false alarm) burglary alarms that go off each day, pulling up Fusus cameras in that area, and looking for “people that <em>look illegal.” </em></p><p>Here’s a not implausible scenario.</p><p>Any one <em>near</em> when burglary alarm that goes off could have ee enough probable cause to require local law enforcement to detain them,  allowing ICE to see if they qualify for deportation this week. And if not, try to scoop them again next week when the checkboxes that make you illegal have be moved around. </p><p>Maybe next week it’ll be Canadians on work permits who’ll have their status suddenly revoked because Justin Trudeau stops following Trump on X. Or maybe Netanyahu will give an unfavorable review to the blueprints for the Trump Gaza Casino, and Israelis will be put on the list of folks who should avoid areas where there might be a commercial burglary alarm going off some where randomly in the city.</p><p>What Council did on Tuesday, though, should in theory prevent commercial burglary alarms from being triggering incidents that allow them to access video footage. The <a href="https://nashville.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7093315&amp;GUID=B64672F3-34E5-419A-B76A-8029F2A246F8&amp;FullText=1">amended ordinances</a> on this 2nd of 3 readings limit MNPD surveillance for “Public Health and Safety” emergencies. As defined, that doesn’t appear to be a <em>possible</em> burglary of a wig shop or cannabis bar. It seems plausbile that if it was otherwise confirmed a burglary was taking place, then they <em>could</em> look at the live video feed. But if I’m honest, my concern isn’t with MNPD.</p><p>It’s that I think Metro’s finest don’t have <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/crb-hears-complaint-against-mnpd/article_3fd47db6-1de0-11ef-9b07-aba8968351f0.html">plenty of ‘spalining to do</a>, and we all seem to be in

internal sexual harassment</a> needs to face a reckoning. </p><p>But I fear that in all of this Us vs Them, this dialectic between the Fusus Opponants vs the Proponants, the Defenders of the Oppressed Others vs the Protectors of the Victimized Inners, the Leftist Progressives vs their Centrist Gen-X sigil holder, there’s been a bit of a <em>ruse</em> taking place.</p><div
