invested community members who supported this bare minimum of oversight. They voted unanimously that a financial audit was warranted.</p><div><hr></div><p>This work is only possible through your support.

The MuniciPals needed a win (we’re gonna make MuniciPals happen! No one’s allowed to co-opt it either!)</p><p>It’s pretty simple. When it comes to OHS, the public has had concerns about how public funds are being used by a particular public institution. The public, the source of all power in all societies (no matter what form of governance is forced upon them), said:</p><p>“Hey, this looks kinda weird. Could someone take a closer look at this and get back to us?”</p><p>And the system, as it seems to rarely do these days, listened.</p><p>What’s important about this decision to audit OHS is not that it affirms that there has been any particular wrongdoing. Nor does it point fingers at anyone who may have engaged in unprofessional practices. That’s what the audit itself is meant to learn. This vote to perform the audit simply says “yeah, we need to take a closer look at this.”</p><p>Yesterday, the Internal Audit Committee demonstrated what those opposing the audit could not: the ability to hold multiple truths simultaneously. Yes, OHS helps some people. But that doesn’t erase the documented $500,000+ in improper payments to Depaul USA, nor excuse the fact that despite ballooning budgets since 2020, housing placements remain flat.</p><div><hr></div><p>Curious about what the Office of Internal audit will be looking at?

I asked the committee to set aside any aspersions cast at those who had brought this request before them, and to consider simple questions:</p><ul><li><p>How was money supposed to be spent, and how was it actually spent?</p></li><li><p>What processes were meant to be followed, and were they actually followed?</p></li><li><p>What was meant to be accomplished, and what was actually accomplished?</p></li></ul><p>Amongst those speaking against putting a magnifying glass on how public money is spent was Allison Cantway, Assistant Director of Planning and Research for the Office of Homeless Services. OHS is, in her words, “an open book.”</p><p>Also speaking against the audit were a variety of residents of Strobel House and the Rodeway Inn, recently unhoused people with inspiring stories of change and redemption which they credited to the Office of Homeless Services.</p><p>Their personal stories were moving and important to be shared. But it was hard to tell what connection their stories had to the specific financial irregularities at the heart of this inquiry, and why they had been asked to share their personal stories at a recorded, public meeting.</p><p>It was all a bit… weird. OHS’s reaction to the potential audit boiled down to: “Everything is fine. We’re an open book! But also, please don’t look at our books. Instead, look at these individuals we’ve helped!”</p><p>The stories of OHS helping individuals overcome the odds of chronic homelessness seemed to be used in lieu of actual metrics of the Office improving the rates of people moving into permanent housing because. <a href="https://prometheoid.substack.com/p/nashvilles-homeless-services-faces">As I documented</a>, there has not been an improvement in these raw figures of housing placements since before OHS’ founding.</p><p>It was a more nuanced defense than Director Calvin made in the first lines of her opening remarks at the Homelessness Symposium this year, referring to things I had written, and articles by the Nashville Scene and The Nashville Banner critical of her office, with the unambiguously Trumpian epithet “Fake News.”</p><p>The audit opposition’s logic was troubling. They paraded success stories as if individual victories could somehow nullify financial irregularities. The implication? Anyone questioning OHS must want the unhoused to suffer. This weaponized the gratitude of vulnerable residents, turning them into human shields against financial scrutiny.</p><p>Meanwhile, OHS claims to be an “open book” while fighting transparency, dismisses documented evidence as “fake news,” and portrays Council Member Ginny Welsch as a persecutor rather than someone doing basic oversight.</p><h2><strong>Why This Audit Was Necessary: Following the Money</strong></h2><p>But how did we get here?</p><p>After being appraised of some concerning practices by OHS, I started requesting financial documents. People say it in movies a lot, and a few people have said it to me in real life (always with a weird look in their eyes), but now I’m saying it to you because honestly nothing has ever proven more true: Follow the money.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png" width="1456" height="799" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:799,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OozF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc54945bf-4e8a-47bd-b926-5a7918efdde8_1746x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A chart I generated via public data shows the problem clearly. While funding into the homelessness system flowing through Metro has ballooned since 2020, housing placements have not moved, at least not since a bump in 2021 when 2x funding-in was matched by 2x housing placements-out. The housing placement changes in 2020-2021 show that there is a way money can translate into more housing placements – but that’s not what we’ve been doing since 2021.</p><p>The only correlation between increased funding and measurable outcomes is the rising number of encampment removals. This creates a troubling paradox: either these displaced individuals aren’t being housed at all (given that permanent housing placements remain flat), or they’re jumping the queue ahead of those who’ve been patiently waiting for housing while avoiding encampments.</p><h2><strong>The Transparency Fight</strong></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2"

She calls it: “institutional betrayal”—when the organizations we depend on violate our trust. </p><p>When individuals betray us, we can lose our faith in people. When institutions betray us, we can lose our faith in the world.</p><p>Freyd also identified the defense mechanism abusive people and institutions use: DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender). Deny wrongdoing, attack questioners, then play victim.</p><p>But you won’t catch anyone admitting that this is what’s going on.</p><p>These are unconscious scripts that play out, with people blind either to the fictionality of betrayal narratives they are manifesting to avoid their own accountability, or the reality they are suppressing because the institutions they’ve built up and supported have failed themselves and others.</p><p>These are the dances of illusion, what India’s Advaita Vedanta calls ‘Maya’, where the veils we weave become the bars of our self-made prisons. In one movement, we choreograph elaborate betrayal narratives, casting ourselves as the wounded protagonist to sidestep the mirror of our own complicity. In another, we perform the ritual of unseeing, our eyes carefully trained away from the cracks in the very foundations we’ve spent lifetimes mortaring with our faith, our labor, our identity.</p><p>As Dr. Freyd describes it, “victims, perpetrators, and witnesses may display betrayal blindness in order to preserve relationships, institutions, and social systems upon which they depend.” We literally cannot see the harm being done because acknowledging it would, seemingly, threaten our survival or our fundamental belief in the systems we depend on.</p><h2><strong>What Happens Next</strong></h2><p>Now that even his Director of Finance has agreed that an audit of OHS—an office O’Connell created as a Councilmember and now directly oversees as Mayor—is warranted, the message is unmistakable: there is something to look at here. Will O’Connell, as advocates have been asking of him for years now, finally examine what’s going on at OHS?</p><p>Truly, if you ask my opinion, no financial audit can fix the types of problems that we’re seeing with OHS. These are psychosocial problems whose terrain belongs more to clergy than accountants.</p><p>Every day we ask our unhoused neighbors to do the hard, internal work of moving through their issues and rising to the occasion before them. We expect them to dig deep and challenge the perspectives and assumptions that, in some small part, contribute to their lot in life. Even though all the research and wisdom of the world tells us that poverty and homelessness is caused much more by systems than any individual’s actions, our housing system in America, increasingly more every day, is built on an expectation that one must work to <em>earn the right to live indoors.</em></p><p>I disagree with this axiom – I think housing is a human right that no one must earn but should be entitled to. I think any system designed not on the principle that <em>housing is a human right</em> is bound to fail, and will unavoidablely exacerbate the problem it is pretending to solve.</p><p>But as long as our systems function on this type of logic, that one must earn their shelter from life’s storms, it is only fair, ethical, and thoroughly <em>democratic</em> to expect our leaders to work through their own personal failings and demons. It is only fair for them to do that <em>on their own time.</em> It is only fair to expect them not to balk and play the victim when we hold them to the same standards of accountability that they hold our most vulnerable and disenfranchised.</p><p>We do this by exerting boundaries on our leaders. We do that by saying: these behaviors, this way of using our collective resources, is unacceptable.</p><p>What happens internally when we set those boundaries, if inside that space our leaders choose to retreat even more into more illusion, to further play the victim card, or if, after much soul searching, they develop the capacity for nuance and accountability — that is between them and their God(s).</p><p>As the taxpaying, voting public, we are not Metro Leadership’s psychologists or clergy. We are something far more respected and feared in America. <strong>We are their employers.</strong></p><p>And we can say: this behavior, this misuse of our collective resources, <em>stops here</em>.</p><p>We ask people experiencing homelessness to confront their demons, accept accountability, and change their behavior. Why should we expect any less from those managing the programs meant to serve them?</p><p>The Audit Committee was told “there is nothing to see here. You’re actually harming our most vulnerable by asking these questions.” The Committee, quite respectfully, did not take the bait. The Office of the Internal Audit will be assigning staff to look into the financial aspects of the request for audit, and will provide updates to the committee.</p><p>The antidote, Dr. Freyd argues, to “institutional betrayal” is “institutional courage”—seeking truth despite unpleasantness, risk, and cost. Yesterday’s unanimous audit vote was exactly that. Institutional courage.</p><p>The question now: Will OHS leadership—and Mayor O’Connell, who directly oversees them—demonstrate the same courage? Or will they continue confusing accountability with attack?</p><p>As Dr. Freyd’s research discovered, you don’t need evil intentions to cause institutional harm. Good people can perpetuate bad systems. The test isn’t whether Director Calvin means well.
