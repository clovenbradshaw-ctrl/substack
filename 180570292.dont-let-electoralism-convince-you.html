<p><strong>SOMETHING ANY SELF RESPECTING LEFTIST</strong><br>can give you is a solid 10 minute diatribe on the dangers of “Electoralism”: the tendency for liberal democracies to boil down civic participation into a thing you do every once in a while at polling places.</p><p>Coined by Stanford Professor Terry Karl, its original meaning is the transition point between authoritarianism and genuine democracy — when you have elections, but they don’t really mean much.</p><p>Often on the Left, it’s expanded to talk about the general get-out-the-vote, #BlueNoMatterWho, Tracy Flick approach to democracy that acts as if dutifully voting straight down the ticket is the whole of our civic duty.</p><p>Electoralism is basically the pathology of Liberalism. It’s not that voting doesn’t matter (and saying it doesn’t is a very cringe Gen X thing to do), but it’s extremely important to say that it’s not the only thing that matters. This is the crossroads between Liberalism and Leftism.</p><p>To a Liberal afflicted with terminal Electoralism, last night in District 7 was a loss. To a Leftist, it was a minor disappointment in a world that provides virtually nothing else, but it was also a clear, salient, burning bush of an indication that we are on the right track and that progress is being made.</p><p>Where Liberalism evolves into Leftism is when it accepts that it is the things between elections that matter far more. What Leftism understands is that elections are not inciting incidents of political stories, they are the climax of silent, intersecting social plot lines bursting forth into consumable narrative.</p><p>To boil down the entire plot of War &amp; Peace, a book that I swear is actually a hella good time, Tolstoy’s argument is that the “Great People” of history, the ones who win elections or declare themselves holy roman emperors — they are not the ones in control of history. It is the times, the unnameable <em>vibes</em>, that pick the important people.</p><p>Every era has some self-deluded fuck who thinks he is Napoleon. Only once in history was history at a place and time where it said “Fuck it. Let’s do a Napoleon.”</p><p>Humans have a wonderful way of misinterpreting cause and effect. It’s because we like to assign agency, to put a figurehead behind events. To personify the order of things that are orders of magnitude beyond our comprehension and control. The whole idea of a Presidential Executive in Chief creates a fiction that a person can be morally liable for all things done in the Republic. It’s a lie, possibly a noble one, possibly not.</p><p>What we’ve learned with the devolution of our nation’s highest office, dating back not to 2016 but more meaningfully to 1968, is that for the most part, a powerful person exerting their singular will to power can mostly only accomplish one thing with that: to break shit.</p><p>It is only <strong>people</strong>, in plural, who ever accomplish anything of note. Just look to the single greatest leader who ever benefitted the state of Tennessee. Not Andrew Jackson or Phil Bredesen or Al Gore. It was FDR.</p><p>FDR improved the lives of more Tennesseans than anyone else has and likely ever will. He was a blue blooded Yankee Democrat from New York in a wheelchair who won Tennessee in a landslide. Not once, but four times. In 1936, he took 68.78% of the vote, the largest margin any candidate had received here since Andrew Jackson himself in 1832.</p><p>He improved the lives of Tennesseans through New Deal programs, particularly the TVA. He built systems that made it more likely for Tennesseans to help each other thrive. And we did. Tennesseans collectively raised the standard of living, education, and life expectancy more than anything ever done in Nashville or Washington.</p><p>Then, having done the work and seen the results, Tennesseans hired him to keep doing it. The electoral victory was the dénouement, not the prologue.</p><p>It’s wrong to say FDR “empowered” people. That language assumes he had power that was his to give us, which we somehow lacked. That’s not how it works. FDR had tools — not power over Tennesseans, but a few levers that could be used to design systems. And he used those tools not for largesse or culture wars or surveillance or technocracy or pork barrel or good vibes or electoralism. He used them to build programs that made it more likely that Tennesseans would make good lives possible for each other.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Let us not be afraid to help each other—let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and Senators and Congressmen and Government officials but the voters of this country.</p><p>Franklin D. Roosevelt, Address at Marietta, Ohio.</p></div><p>But FDR did not do this in a vacuum. He did not bend reality into a shape such that it needed him to fix it, the strategy that domestic abusers and presidential despots employ. Rather, he listened to the times, endured extraordinary hardships, and when disease took his legs, he created a place of healing and respite for others with polio to create community and shared courage.</p><p>The times made FDR. And the times let FDR reshape Tennessee and all of America as a place that cared about basic, kitchen table things.</p><p>Things like feeding kids, fixing roads, and funding hospitals.</p><p>The times had to be bad enough to require FDR. We are approaching the centennial of the stock market crash that brought the Great Depression.</p><p>In four years it will have been 100 since that last epoch of fantasy economics destroyed the world as we knew it. When inequality was worshiped as a golden calf and the golden rule was for suckers born yesterday. It took the crucifixion of the American dream for us to realize we had been living in a nightmare of self-interest. And it took FDR and the New Deal for us to realize that the only way out was each other.</p><p>We may have to learn that lesson again the hard way. Society is a conscious being, with a memory that extends beyond our individual lives. But like all beings, sometimes we repeat our mistakes, worse again the second time to see if we really aren’t immortal. But other times, we learn, and we don’t do it quite so bad again.</p><p>Aftyn lost yesterday. And to Electoralists and Democratic Party employees, it’s an L.</p><p>But to those who understand that reality is constituted of the un-pollable, ephemeral, yet all the more real animal spirits that form the sacred <em>vibes of history</em>, this campaign is one of the biggest victories in Tennessee history. Because Tennessee is not a place, it is a social being (that rarely votes) and it, like all beings, is learning. And it is saying:</p><blockquote><p>To all the nihilistic political gameplayers that are tit-for-tatting ourselves into the apocalypse, to the technofascist surveillance thespians whose only dream is to digitize away humanity, to all the culture warriors who persecute the sacred other to dissociate themselves away from their own shameful boners, to all political trust fund dilettantes who don’t mind autocracy as long as the logo has the proper hex code blue,</p><p>Respectfully, <em>fuck off.</em></p></blockquote><p>You heard us. We want the simple building blocks that ever gave America a shot at being great. Complex things are made of simpler things. And what Tennessee needs is simple.</p><p>We need to feed kids, fix roads, fund hospitals.</p><p>The electorate took a wild swing last night, something even dyed in the wool Electoralists are taking note of. The work that brought this near complete victory is the same thing that will be done tomorrow by the same people who did it yesterday. They probably won’t get much credit for it. The people who hold our social fabric together rarely get as much airtime as those who wear it to campaign events.</p><p>An elected official asked me a while back: “How do we break through? How do we get out the vote when it’s so rigged against us?”</p><p>“Rigged against us,” I thought? As if we have some god-given right to be the ones in charge because we’re Democrats? This is not a question FDR would have asked. This is the preoccupation of the terminal electoralist: “What do I need to tell them I’ll do so they put me in charge?”</p><p>What Aftyn’s unfathomably successful campaign showed us yesterday is that this logic is backwards. You start, like in all jobs, by doing it — often informally (which is usually when we do our best work). And once we do it enough, the people tend to notice, and they hire us to do it full time.</p><p>How do we not come close next time but win it outright? It’s not about messaging better or blowing up people’s phones with an even ruder amount of GOTV spam texts (y’all need to fix that shit). You do it through all the actions you take that are explicitly <em>not</em> about winning elections but <em>actually about helping.</em></p><p>Tennesseans aren’t bad at voting. Tennessee politicians are bad at being people who deserve to be voted for.</p><p>But Aftyn has showed the way. To win the hearts and minds before you win the job, you need to do the things that Tennesseans need. You need to feed kids, fix roads, fund hospitals with whatever means, great or small, you have. </p><p>I mean this quite literally. Aftyn has shown us: if you raise money and feed hungry children, raise hell at council meetings and get pot holes fixed and bus lanes installed, and heckle the Governor to accept Medicaid expansion or anything else to keep our rural hospitals’ lights on, <em>you will win.</em></p><p>It’s actually that simple. And many of you with political aspirations will come up with objections to this strategy, and insist you need to have the position to make those changes. To you, I say, <em>just try.</em> If you are resistant, if you insist we must take you on your word that you will <em>start representing us </em>once we give you the title of <em>representative, </em>I call bullshit. The proof that you deserve the responsibility is that you take it on before it is given.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>For charity literally translated from the original means love, the love that understands, that does not merely share the wealth of the giver, but in true sympathy and wisdom helps men to help themselves.</p><p>— FDR, 1936 Acceptance Speech for the Renomination for the Presidency</p></div><p>Not to make this rousing homily about democracy about me, but yesterday I achieved a life long dream of being a published, professional (read: paid) journalist. I did not do this by first getting the job, the “title” of journalist, and only then learning how to do it. I did it, as you’ve read along, out loud, in front of you, over the past two years. I made many mistakes and I stayed up until 2 AM more nights than not. But out of this urgent energy I’ll call civic duty (a vibe I must confess I saw far too little of working in local government), I could not stop myself. And when the moment arose for someone to competently detail what is happening in our city and to explain it to a national audience, I was prepared.</p><p>Yet that is not what many who desire power plan for. First they will be appointed to represent our interest, and then they will learn on the job how to do this. On-the-job learning is a white collar phenomenon. Real trades require either schooling, apprenticing, or plain old moonlighting until you get a break. What Aftyn demonstrated in her work as a state rep, an organizer, a social worker, is that she <em>already knew how to listen and represent people’s needs.</em> </p><p>That is what I ask of you. Do not wait to do the work. Do not expect the world to see your latent magic and admire you for the spells you might cast. The world usually does not need magic. Usually, it just need food for children, and good roads to get to quality hospitals. And strangely, it is usually only then, when you resign yourself to your place amongst mortals, that your magic actually appears. Precisely when it is needed.</p><div class="pullquote"><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"
